 Shannon T 	  My family loved it! My 8-year-old is now completely obsessed with Batman Legos!
 Anita B 	  My kids loved it, me not so much.
 Thomas S 	  The Lego Batman Movie is the funniest thing you'll ever watch! The plot was great! There was nothing wrong with this movie!
 Gary C 	  Saw this in 4DX with my 12 year old nephew. Surprisingly I actually really enjoyed it.
 Lee M 	  Its third act can't be over fast enough, but Lego Batman is still about as funny and sharp as its predecessor.
 Isadore H 	  Will Arnet proves that his hilarious voice acting as batsman in The Lego Movie can stand on its own here. Once again, the jokes come at you at blistering speed, and it can be difficult to keep up. When the film slows down to insert its family friendly themes, it came to an absurdly jarring halt. However, this movie did what I wanted it to, which was make me laugh. A lot
 Jeffrey H 	  Great to watch whether it's with your kids or on your own!!!Feel good flick!
 Sarah T 	  Fantastic story & pacing!
 Ben C 	  The best movie featuring Batman in almost a decade. So much better than BvsS!
 Brandon D 	  Very funny with a wonderful story with hints of Toy Story. Good fun
 Venissia%20 P 	  The best batman movie that ever existed, all the references to the old franchises, the animation, the feels, everything was perfect. 10/10 will buy the DVD
 Josh L 	  Funny with a good story.
 Adam D 	  bloody brilliant. funny for both kids and adults alike. jokes come thick and fast and the story is a lot of fun too
 Ellen C 	  So much fun to watch. Will own it.
 Andy D 	  4 stars. Fast paced, funny movie. Worth a watch if you like Batman
 Chris A 	  So... watching Batman hit on Batgirl was really creepy based on past knowledge... Judging this films on its own merits is something I had to force myself to do. I really love how much this film when into the Dark Knights history. It was really funny and really detailed and you would not even recognize it if you knew nothing about Batman. Its a good film with a good message.
 Fred H 	  Perfect family fun with lots of historical Batman in-jokes.
 Dinesh J 	  Fun fun fun! but no story, if u like stories.
 Matthew R 	  A shell of The Lego Movie. Entertaining for the kids, but lacks the humor and charm of what launched a potential movie franchise.
 Jarrod J 	  Everything About Lego Batman is AwesomeLet??s face it: there are several reasons why laugh-out-loud comedies don??t win Oscars. Not the least of which is that the judges are a dour lot of people who hate fun, but also because it??s easy to make an audience laugh. It??s an easy emotion to garner from an audience. An audience??s natural inclination is to laugh, regardless of the piece that they??re seeing. Make a scene uncomfortable enough, and an audience will laugh. It requires so little effort that when it comes to judging such films, one must do so with an extra critical eye. That being said, Lego Batman is the masterpiece of mirth the world needed (though not the one it deserves). With its soon-to-be legendary humor, its twists on the character and the genre, and its endearing character development, Lego Batman, like the toy, is well constructed, and fun for all ages.Back by popular demand, Will Arnett reprises his role as the Lego Batman: an egotistical superhero who writes and sings his own theme songs by night, and a reclusive billionaire waiting for the night by day. The Joker (Zach Galifianakis), determined to get Batman to crawl out of his emotionless shell and get him to admit that he hates The Joker above all others, hatches a nefarious plan to recruit the most eclectic group of supervillains ever formed. In order to stop him, Batman must face his fear of letting people in, and team up with his butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes), Commissioner Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson), and his newly adopted son, Dick Grayson (Michael Cera).Of course they had almost 80 years of Batman history to riff about, and while they didn't miss a facet in this Batman roast, the humor went so much further beyond that. An artistic melding of script and actor lead to some of the best delivered jokes this side of the decade. With so much wit that they got away with a Robin's-name-is-Dick joke while still flying under the PG radar. The pure subtlety of the film's true humor lets it layer like a well constructed Lego city, allowing the kids to enjoy the over-the-top characters on the surface, and letting the adults come back a second time to catch all the jokes they missed the first time, because it's impossible to take it all in in one sitting (I speak from experience).The jokes didn??t stop there, though. Not only did they nail the Batman/DC jokes, but they used their license agreements to hit every fandom from Harry Potter to Doctor Who. Pandering? Oh yeah. Effective? Like Bat-shark repellent. Audiences roared over the clash of cultures, making it fun for Batman fans and haters alike.This wasn??t the only impressive side of Lego Batman. As previously stated, humor comes naturally. What was really impressive was that the characters and story were so well written that it allowed the audience to emotionally connect with caricatures. The rule of thumb is that the more closely a character hits home, the easier it is to connect with, yet by the end of the film I felt myself caring for a character played by Michael Cera; a feat I never thought was possible. Even The Joker tugged at heartstrings as he desperately tried to be hated by his mortal enemy in this clever take on what was essentially a relationship comedy.Now this is not to say that you have to go see it, or that it??s destined to win an Oscar for its clever ploys and fresh takes on tired tales. No, this is saying you should go see it twice, and that it should win an Oscar. See what put the ??go?? in Lego.
 Dougas C 	  Very humorous and original.
 luis m 	  best movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
 Ted L 	  what i liked about it was that every minute of it was funny,or had a lot of action. what i didn't like about it was is that there wasn't enough humor. Also they didn't show much of the other characters feelings and actions.
 Jeff P 	  The best writing is in the various previews, the story was too all over the map and over the top, attempting to distract kids with an excessively short attention span and still entertain adults. Too much was like nails on a chalkboard, just waiting for it to be done.
 Brennan M 	  It was an amazing movie with a lot of laugh out loud moments. It did kinda butcher the Batman franchise though.
 Thomas W 	  DC remembered how to have fun!
 Todd L 	  Not as fun as the Lego Movie, but a nice bit of deconstructive comedy about the Dork Knight.
 Ricky W 	  Na Na Na Na Na Na Naa. Batman!
 Israel Z 	  Good movie for everyone.
 Monty D 	  Is it weird that I find the joker and Harley Quinn in this movie better and more developed then the joker and Harley Quinn in Suicide squad? No. It's not weird. It is very true.
 Jose H 	  Not exactly meant for adults but you can get some laughs out of this movie but personally not a big fan on the way the movie layout is.
 Jesse G 	  A worthy follow up to The Lego Movie but one that stands on it's own two legs. Well worth the the ticket price.
 Claus M 	  Funniest movie I've seen in a long, long time. I took a 9, 11, and 13 year old to see it. There were some jokes and references only an older person would get. I'm going to see it again only because there's so much to catch and the movie just hits the jokes with rapid fire.
 Brayden R 	  This lego movie definitely meets expectations!?
 Jeffrey B 	  Family fun for this Lego 'fanily'!
 The Falcon J 	  This was a hilarious fun packed movie that both complemented Lego and Batman well! However if you don't know much about batman some of the references and jokes may make absolutely no sense to you at all. I would highly recommend this film even if some of the jokes are repetitive .
 Daniel M 	  Some funny moments and some surprising references to the other batman films. 3.5/5
 Harmen D 	  We all know Batman rocks. Hes proven that again with this movie, but now its from Lego, wich means you can expect a whole lot of things that dont make sense, but hey, every movie doesnt make sense these days.
 Carson B 	  Definitely not as good as the Lego Movie. The Lego Batman Movie is extremely convoluted and tonally uneven, it also takes forever to end. But in the end it pays off as a funny and mostly entertaining movie that my mom fell asleep in.
 Keri K 	  Fun movie! The commercials dont do it justice!
 John L 	  Family friendly movie that combined the best of the 2014, Lego Movie and every single incarnation of Batman including the 1966 Adam West version.
 Matthew J 	  Great movie to see with the kids.
 Dylan R 	  besides the fact it it batman and lego, it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen
 Chris F 	  The LEGO Batman Movie is a consistently fun and entertaining animated film. Will Arnett is great as the voice of Batman. He really is the star of the show. Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, and Ralph Fiennes were all good in their supporting roles. I really liked how they portrayed the character of Batman. It really stayed true to his character while also being very unique in its own way. The film has many jokes that for the most part work. The kids will be distracted by the colorful action while the adults will laugh at the numerous cultural references. The jokes come by too fast at times. Some may fly over your head in the first viewing. Also, the film lacks the emotional impact the original LEGO movie had. Overall, while it isn't an improvement over its predecessor, it still entertains in its own right. It captures the world of Gotham perfectly, and is also very hilarious.
 Daniel B 	  Awesome film. Loves it.
 Jay H 	  I actually fell asleep during parts of this.
 Torion O 	  The references are everywhere. Great fun.
 Glenda L 	  it is so good and awsome
 Hamza S 	  i want to see this movie!!!!!!
 Adolfo A 	  No as good as the first one and it is not even close. I guess I never got all the WB movies and previous Batman movies references but I did in the first movie. It just did not work for me or my wife (yeah, we went on a romantic night, no kids)
 Calum R 	  Growing up, Lego meant everything to me, my aspirations of becoming an architect, and even the result of me studying design engineering in university, were all due to my fascination with Lego as a child and the complex structures you could craft and create. In 2014, upon the announcement of 'The Lego Movie', despite my love for the toy, I was kinda doubting the general premise. How could you make a movie out of Lego? Well, that question was soon answered as I gawped in awe at the screen, the movie was fantastic. Now, the character from 'The Lego Movie' that garnered the most love was Batman, a cocky, sarcastic, childish take on the superhero we know and love... well it was only going to be a matter of time before he got his own motion picture.'The Lego Batman Movie' was definitely an enjoyable ride, and whilst I think it lacks in comparison to its predecessor, it stills thrusts us back into the universe that we came to revere in 2014. With an admirable cast of voice talent, and stunning animated visuals, 'The Lego Batman Movie' boasts undeniable creative talent, but does at times seem to be trying a little too hard to be funny, building off the reputation the initial film garnered.Is this film worth viewing? Most definitely, it's a hilarious feel-good animated comedy, and definitely perfect for the younger audience. I actually saw this film prior to its full release during a preview a few days early, however I believe it may have been aimed more as a kids matinee... I was literally the only adult there, shameful I know, but heck, I didn't care. The kids in the audience continually laughed with glee, so its definitely something suited for that kind of audience, but don't skip over the older adults who are still children at heart, it's an alluring comedy that piles on the laughs, definitely worth a watch.
 Campbell C 	  This just became one of my favorite movies. This is so fun and energetic compared to the other Batman films. GO SEE
 M N 	  Cute flick with some good laughs. But not anywhere as good as the first Lego movie.
 Albert W 	  A smart, fun, animated comedy that both kids and adults can enjoy. Full of surprisingly good action sequence in Lego Format and very well developed characters that no one could've expected when going to the movie.
 Daniel S 	  The film's story was a bit predictable from the start, so if you're a teen or adult you'll probably be a bit bored while watching this. Despite all this, the movie still brings in some of the same kicks from the Lego movie.
 Dave W 	  From the opening black screen to the final credits. This movie delivered. I took the kids expecting a predictable pleasant but bland movie and found that the various parents were all laughing uncontrollably at times, we likely strained our abs. Batman makes some really good points about the importance of looking after your abs, so it was all good, Glad I saw it in a crowed theatre.
 Zoe N 	  Very funny! I look forward to getting it on DVD. Laughs galore from minute one.
 Edgar M 	  As seen as a realistic and dark character, Lego Batman is a insane and comedy film with an outstanding performance and fantastic animation.
 Mark D 	  Best lego movie so funny
 Jacob M 	  Literally the best Batman movie
 Greg B 	  "The Lego Batman Movie" is the latest in the line of product placement movies for the notorious toy. In this film, Lego Joker wants to take over Gotham City with his band of criminals, and Batman is consigned to stop him. Batman deals with a cathartic struggle because he believes he doesn't need anyone, and this motif is recycled throughout the film. While the interplay of Batmans emotions and the colorful action make for a watchable film, the action is also whirlwind and confusing. This movie tries to be so much in 100 minutes that it leaves many characters underdeveloped and static. Instead of trying to be its own movie, it borrows heavily from pop culture and does too much product placement to be a standout Lego film. While not terrible, the first Lego movie was vastly superior. Children might enjoy the chaotic scenes but adults will be left scrambling ------------------------------------------------------ B-
 Lindsey G 	  kept me and my family laughing the whole movie. watched it twice! loved every minute!
 Zane M 	  Funny, Action packed, Fun all around, and Batman! The LEGO Batman Movie brings the fun and action from DC Comics and other Warner Brothers movies, and crafts another spectacular blockbuster out of LEGO's, just like its predecessor The LEGO Movie.
 August V 	  Doesn't do its predecessor justice, and manages to make fun of everything but its own cliches, but is nevertheless still a good time, and worth watching
 Dareyll D 	  A fun, comedic ride but the plot could have used some polish.
 Andy G 	  This movie can make a black screen exiting.
 Genoveva Z 	  too long for a kids movie
 Joel H 	  The Lego Batman movie is a fun ride for any Batman fan. There are so many references and allusions to The Dark Knight's past works that it's difficult to catch them all. And while the plot is stretched a little thin, the voice work is well done and the animation keeps you engaged. Lego is starting to build a respectable movie franchise.
 Nge N 	  We will you our papa dad dad Win papa kyaw.
 Patrick L 	  "The LEGO Batman Movie doesn't have the same creative energy or irreverent spirit that made the first "LEGO Movie" so great but it really succeeds as a hilarious parody of the Batman character himself"Movie Review: The LEGO Batman MovieDate Viewed: February 10 2017Directed By Chris McKayScreenplay By Seth Grahame-Smith, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Jared Stern and John Whittington, Story By Seth Grahame-Smith, Based on Lego Construction Toys and "Batman" characters created by Bob Kane and Bill FingerFeaturing the voices of Will Arnett, Zach Galifianakis, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, Ralph Fiennes, Mariah Carey, Hector Elizondo, Jenny Slate, Lauren White, Eddie Izzard, Seth Green, Jemaine Clement, Billy Dee Williams, Riki Lindhome, Conan O'Brien, Zoe Kravitz, Jason Mantzoukas, Kate Micucci, Doug Benson, Matt Villa, Laura Kightlinger, Ellie Kemper, Adam DeVine, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.When "The LEGO Movie" came out in 2014, I was excited for it but I didn't expect to make it on my Top 10 movies list that year but I was wrong. Thanks to the people who did "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" and "21 & 22 Jump Street", "The LEGO Movie" was a work of pure genius and it became a masterpiece and it was based on a toy brand. "The LEGO Batman Movie" doesn't have the same creative energy or irreverent spirit from the first "LEGO Movie" but it really succeeds as a hilarious parody of the Batman character himself.Even though it is a role that he can do in his sleep, Will Arnett is nails it once again as the Lego Batman who is more comedic and fun compared to previous Caped Crusaders. "The LEGO Batman Movie" is the best DC Comics movie right now even though it's not a part of the DC cinematic universe. Instead of making his superhero movies dark and so serious, maybe Zack Snyder should borrow some Lego blocks and make a more fun superhero movie than "Batman v Superman".Speaking of "Batman" films, there are some clever riffs to all the previous movies and the action here is pretty entertaining. "The LEGO Batman Movie" should suit well for comic book and Lego fanboys alike and we finally have a Batman who likes to play around in his mansion and with his toys. Set of course in Gotham City, Batman (voiced by Arnett) continues to fight crime and save the city from his arch-nemesis The Joker (voiced by Zack Galifianakis). When Batman hurts the Joker's feelings by saying that he's not important in his life, he weeps and he plots a revenge plan on the Batman by simply surrendering himself to the Gotham City police.Joker and along with the rest of Batman's villains crash a winter gala which is celebrating the retirement of Commissioner Gordon (voiced by Hector Elizondo) and they just simply surrender themselves to the police in an orderly fashion. This not only puzzles Batman but also to Commissioner Gordon's daughter, Barbara Gordon (voiced by Rosario Dawson) who both suspect that the Joker might be plotting something big. With every single bad guy in Gotham City (except for Harley Quinn) locked up in Arkham Asylum, Batman is free to do whatever he likes which includes eating lobster, watching movies and hanging out in his Batcave. Still believing that the Joker remains a threat to Gotham City, Batman decides to banish him into the Phantom Zone by stealing Superman's (voiced by Channing Tatum) Phantom Zone projector but his loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth (voiced by Ralph Fiennes) wants him and his alter ego Bruce Wayne to stay in the mansion and take charge of Dick Grayson (voiced by Michael Cera), the young orphan he unwillingly adopted during the gala.Batman or Bruce Wayne takes the foster kid in to be his sidekick Robin and they manage to recover the Projector while attending Superman's "Justice League" party and they use it to banish the Joker into the Phantom Zone which is a prison for some of the most dangerously powerful villains in the Lego multiverse which include Lord Voldemort (voiced by Eddie Izzard), King Kong (voiced by Seth Green), Sauron from "Lord of the Rings" (voiced by Jemaine Clement), the Wicked Witch of the West (voiced by Riki Lindhome), the Gremlins, the Kraken and even Agent Smith from "The Matrix".Angry over his arrogance and recklessness, Barbara Gordon locks up both Batman and Robin because she believes the Joker wanted to sucked into the Phantom Zone and her suspicions were right as the Joker and the other trapped villains manage to get out of the Phantom Zone and they cause mayhem and destruction in Gotham City. It is time for Batman and his friends to not only save the day but to also find the real hero he's supposed to be.Like the bats that fly around in the Batcave, the hilarious puns and in-jokes fly all over the place in "The LEGO Batman Movie". With a screamingly funny script from Seth Grahame-Smith, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Jared Stern and John Whittington, "The LEGO Batman Movie" works as a spoof to the entire "Batman" franchise in general with some extra ingredients from "Robot Chicken" and "The Naked Gun". Speaking of "Robot Chicken", the movie was directed by Chris McKay who is a "Robot Chicken" alum himself. McKay lightens this "Batman" movie up with beautiful animation, colorful characters and nifty touches to the Caped Crusader's history.The one thing I didn't like about "The LEGO Batman Movie" is that I thought there were too many villains. I know this is supposed to be a parody of the "Batman" character but this movie has every single bad guy the Caped Crusader has ever faced. They got the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, The Riddler (voiced by Conan O'Brien), Scarecrow (voiced by Jason Mantzoukas), Catwoman (voiced by Zoe Kravitz), Killer Croc, Bane and Two-Face (who's voiced by Billy Dee Williams who finally plays him after playing his alter ego Harvey Dent in the 1989 "Batman" movie).Again, it doesn't have the same creative impact or visual wonder from the first "LEGO Movie" which I loved and cared deeply for unlike the Academy Awards but with terrific voice work, colorful animation and dynamic funny humor, "The LEGO Batman Movie" serves as a brilliantly funny lampooning to one of the most popular superheroes of all time.
 Tim S 	  Had a funny moment or two but i was surprised on how much this movie was lacking.
 Adam H 	  Eh. It was ok. Comically in line with other Lego presentations. I dozed off once or twice. My 14 yr son liked it.
 Rich O 	  Awesome, Entertaining, Action, Funny, can't say more....
 Mark C 	  Some kids movies are accessible to both children and adults; The Lego Batman Movie isn't one of them. As feared, this was 100 minutes of someone flashing a loud "PLEASE LAUGH" sign in your face constantly. I need a Tylenol.
 Nelson P 	  Brooding, dark, tormented, these are the words that come to mind when one mentions Batman. Whether you read about him in the pages of DC's comic books or follow his adventures in Nolan or Synder's universe, everyone knows the Batman is one superhero/vigilante that bad dudes do not want to be caught down a dark alley with. However, this self serious attitude that surrounds the cape crusader can be a turn off to some long time fans that prefer the superhero portion of the character, rather than the deep character study of Bruce Wayne and his gallery of rogues that is often covered. Director Chris McKay aims to change all of that and gives us one of the most hilarious and heart felt takes on the dark knight, ever.The villains are on the loose and on the prowl, ready to blow a hole through the heart of Gotham City and send it sinking to the Lego abyss below. Not while Batman is on the clock! With his master builder skills, Batman makes short work of his foes and cements to his greatest villains and everyone else that he works alone and does not need anyone. This is the key to the story as Lego Batman explores the depth of what makes Batman a compelling character and drives to keep those he cares for as far as away as possible to keep them out of harms way. Gone is the long winded and repetitive backstory which we have seen a thousand times (most recently in 2016's unhappy BvS), instead we get an enriching story of the importance of family and accepting that not everything can be controlled or prevented and handled alone.At the core of the film is a fantastic message for children to take in, covered in eye popping CGI reminiscent of the fast paced, colorful Lego Movie from a few years back. Everything here, script wise, is just as tight and quick as it was before with many jokes for both children and their parents (or inquisitive and nerdy adults like myself). As a fan of comic books and all things Batman, the film packs in many references to Batman's history in all mediums, including film, TV, comic book, and more! Eagle eyed fans will spot characters and pieces of Batman lore peppered throughout the film and be introduced to the most obscure villains to come out of the pages of DC's comic books (Condiment Man was a real thing, wait until you see him). Will Arnett brings Batman to roaring life, giving the character the perfect mix of dark and funny, accompanied by a stellar cast that features Micheal Cera as Robin, Ralph Fiennes as Alfred, Rosario Dawson as Barbara Gordon, and Zack Galifianakis as the most upbeat and adorable (that's right, I said adorable) version of Joker you have ever seen. So grab the kiddos or plan a cool Saturday afternoon and catch Lego Batman while it's still in theaters. It's the perfect film for the comic book kid in all of us!
 Joseph G 	  The Lego Batman Movie concentrates a lot of its laughs in the first half of the film, and doesn't quite achieve the same level of story-telling as 2014's The Lego Movie, but Chris McKay and his team got something incredibly right with this film, and that's fun. Lego Batman felt like a breath of fresh air after years of dark, gloomy films from Warner Bros. and DC. The respect for the source material, the humorous references to past iterations of the character and the franchises he has been a part of, and the light-hearted, feel-good tone of the film makes The Lego Batman Movie a great watch for the whole family, and definitely worth repeat viewings.
 CommandCape 3 	  It's a good movie and a lot of heart in it?
 Anthony C 	  That was absolutely a great movie! I liked this movie a lot because it has of the characters from Batman and many others from different movies. It's a movie that you don't want to miss out!
 Craig E 	  Entertaining movie. Nice job of including Harley Quinn, Bane and so many others while including the Superman rivalry.
 Monny M 	  Saw this in the theater yesterday. It was okay.
 Michele M 	  Fantastic movie! Gave me a whole new appreciation for Batman.
 Lync P 	  Lego Batman is amazing. Google it.
 Ben H 	  Absolutely brilliant - humour for both children and adults - great animation and voicing with loads of classic batman references
 Andres A 	  An astonishingly loving AND irreverent parody AND celebration of the Caped Crusader. But, a caveat... Batman beatboxes... the theater was awkwardly quiet.
 ActingGuy 1 	  The Lego Batman Movie suffers lack of pace and plot, but on the other hand, its animation of bricks is beautiful and it has a great script.
 Lee D 	  Very clever and funny. Good movie.
 Benjamin R 	  Amazing movie not just for kids but also for adults
 Chris B 	  This film is extremely clever and funny. Chris McKay really understands the history and character of Batman. This film is very self referencing and acknowledges the mistakes of other Batman installations. Will Arnet does a perfect job voicing Batman. The lego animation is great and works really well with action scenes. The story is also really well done, it tackels a serious subject matter that is relevant in Batman films.
 Sebastian N 	  Fairly fun movie. DARKNESS!!!! NO PARENTS!!!!
 Jonathan R 	  Funny at times not a bad movie
 David S 	  Very witty like the first. So many jokes packed into every minute. I'm assuming kids just watch it for the lego.
 Jim A 	  Funny, fast paced, and with a nice visual flair and wit this movie has plenty to entertain both adults and kids even if some of its humor gets a bit repetitive towards the end. Its references to previous incarnations of Batman are particularly humorous
 Jennifer M 	  Bored me extremely. No "new" conflict/plot.
 Massimo D 	  Great movie lives up to its predecessor The Lego Movie
 PlayBoy aka S 	  Funny throughout..but kinda got too mushy the last 10 mins or so..I understand morals in the story but the segment felt too long.
 Jonathan M 	  Lego score a goal with this movie!
 Mia R 	  very funny and every member of the family is sure to enjoy! :)
 Josh H 	  Often what happens with spin-off movies and shows is that they have to take a few things that made the character stand out in small parts in the original movie and stretch it out over a whole movie. This got a little old but still really entertaining.
 Collin S 	  Although it wasn't as good as the original Lego Movie, it was and enjoyable movie for all ages, and it makes another very good installment in the Lego Movie franchise
 kayleigh%20 p 	  This movie was hilarious and great for the whole family. My brother, dad, and I all went to see it together and not only were we laughing the whole time but everyone else in the movie theater as well. This is a great lego movie for the kids and the adults can enjoy all the innuendos that take place. I definitely recommend this movie to all ages. This is a great movie if you need a good laugh.
 Lori A 	  Was actually looking fwd to it ending
 BrandonMC . 	  Best Lego Batman Movie I Ever Saw In Years!
 Jake M 	  The Lego Batman Movie (2017) - was not a movie I was solely anticipating to see. For those that don't know, I have this somewhat dislike toward the Lego version of Batman. I don't necessarily hate him and he did have a few funny lines but I never understood his purpose in the first "Lego movie" but It seems like everyone else loved this character. You could imagine that I wasn't super hyped when I heard about a Lego batman movie. However, when I saw the score on the tomatometer at a surprisingly high percentage it convinced me to see the movie despite not liking the character and Holy cow, the movie was a lot better then I was expecting. I was surprised how the story had a great deal of funny references and some heartfelt moments. I do like some of the jokes especially when it comes to referencing Batman's movie History or breaking the fourth wall in the opening and closing of the movie. I also really like how this movie dives deep into the Batman character and actually gives him a understandable personality. I think it's actually great that they put the spotlight on Batman because we get to know him on a more personal level. The rest of the characters like Robin are supportive to Batman and work off of him nicely. It's works even better when they challenge Batman's persona and make him come to terms with his feelings. Even the Joker has a funny personality and like Batman, they also give him some understanding. I think it's no secret that the animation is spectacular. Just like the previous film, the animation is top notch and it captures the movement of lego bricks whether it be people or tall buildings and large landscapes. The action is fast paced and there is always something happening on the screen, it just never stops but every now and then they do take time to slow down. The music is a mix of pop songs and an orchestral soundtrack. The pop songs admittedly aren't really needed but they only happen once in awhile and they still keep most of the music on the orchestral soundtrack. I really had no idea why this needed to exist but at the same time I was amazed on the effort they put into this movie. They took a character I disliked from the original "Lego Movie" and turned him into a character that I can actually sympathize with. Much like how Batman admitted his feelings, I have to admit mind. This was a major surprise and it once again proved that Everything is still Awesome. (A-)
 Don S 	  Great for kids and adults! Loved it
 Silver Screen S 	  Absolutely fantastic- enjoyable as hell, and sure to be a movie I rewatch many times in the future.
 Lyndon M 	  Funny I'll check it out on TV!
 Winston C 	  Liked it but I thought Lego Movie was more entertaining.
 Monica H 	  Very funny and cute!
 A D 	  fell asleep, but my kids loved it
 Dale P 	  A film likely elevated simply by not being directed by Zack Snyder with his patented grit-o-vision. It got a lot right about Batman while poking fun at him.
 Cassidy S 	  Not as good as as the original, but it's still adorable! I especially loved Robin, voiced oh-so-charismatically and by Michael Cera!
 Tony S 	  Well done. Spoofs the recent movies yet stays true to the character.
 Darian M 	  The Lego Batman Movie is a PG version of Deadpool. Self aware, hilarious, and very in tune with its audience. While falling flat of a 'grand finale' towards the end, this adaptation brings some much needed colour and humanity to the citizens of Gotham City. Move over Ben Affleck, Christian Bale, Val Kilmer, Adam West, Lewis G Wilson *catches breath*, Robert Lowrey-, forget it.
 Shawn H 	  Fun family movie, good humor and meaningful lessons
 Demitrius J 	  This movie is more better than the recent batman movies?
 Kyleigh T 	  Funny, moving and all above ridiculous! Amazing kids movie and I loved the fandom references inside it (Harry Potter, Doctor Who, LOTD)! Just as good if not better than the first Lego Movie. Though I'm not a fan of D.C., this is definitely Certified Fresh that they deserve!
 Patrick L 	  Relentlessly funny, witty, and fast-paced, the Lego Batman Movie is a family-friendly story about the greatest superhero of all time: Batman. The film has plenty of action and beautiful, deft animation. Combine both of these things with a fun sense of humor, self-awareness, and a great moral for kids and adults alike, and movie-goers are left with a film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.For me, it's a 4.5/5.
 NintendoJackson . 	  A little more on the kids side of a movie but still pretty funny and has some adult hunter in there it's a good movie and sends a great message to kids about friends
 Nicholas M 	  The movie is significantly worse than its predecessor, the Lego Movie. Here, all of the things that made the Lego Movie accessible to all ages have been removed. The result is a childish movie with the same jokes related to Batman from the first movie played over and over again. Redundant and satisfying for small children, but not worthwhile for adults.
 Jake B 	  Funniest movie since 2015. Comedy every minute. So much action with the joker and I won't spoil for anyone else but there are a lot of familiar bad guys
 Jasmine L 	  Absolutely hilarious!!!
 jason c 	  Definitely a well written movie with some great jokes. The vice acting was great and it was fun seeing all the cameos from the DC comics. With that said the movie was a bit long. Even for me. I can only imagine it felt long for a child.
 Kyle T 	  It's funny, but a bit one dimensional.
 Liesl E 	  Not quite as good or memorable as The Lego Movie, but still very clever and fun.
 Sean P 	  I really didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The whole movie was basically a lesson to Batman about how being alone was wrong. And while I accept that these movies use the Lego universe and not the Marvel universe, having all the villains turn good was too cheery for me.
 Juan T 	  Horrible! The story telling was as bad as watching two 5 year olds playing with a bunch of random action figure toys. For those adults that enjoyed the first Lego movie, don't expect the same humor, this Lego Batman is made for kids only.
 John H 	  CBT vs Batman. Amazing animation. Lots of laughs.
 lucas s 	  it is a lame movie them use the lego movie batman not lego batman from the lego batman video games
 Supes S 	  It is a very fun and exciting movie. The animation is stunning and overall it's a fun ride with heartwarming story starring DC Comics' greatest characters.
 Abraham B 	  Batman was exaggerated and un-enjoyable. The comic relief was poor and the plot was horrendous, so much so that they had to include the villains they did.
 Matthew B 	  Funny for all ages. Some of the scenes are scatter shot - so it's hard to see all the details. But otherwise really enjoyable and appropriate for everyone.
 Jordan J 	  It is no where near as good as the lego movie, but it is still a good movie. This movie is really funny but I felt like the movie was a little bit over stuffed with too many things going on. This movie is like a family version of robot chicken and is successful with the things it is making fun of. The animation is really good and well done. This is a good movie but just doesn't hit the highest note lik the first lego movie.
 Ronaldo S 	  Really funny and touching at times, and full of references to earlier Batman movies and shows
 Nathan S 	  I had really high expectations, but the best scenes were all in the trailers. Overall, a funny movie but no where near as good as the Lego Movie.
 Chris M 	  Better than the Lego movie!!!
 Tiffany C 	  Cute.. real cute. Batman was shot mess lol
 Tyler S 	  Funny, but it falls flat at times and doesn't quite find the cleverness of its theatrical predecessor.
 Garrett H 	  I saw this movie with 2 of my best friends and it is a great movie! It is filled with REALLY funny scenes from the intro of the movie to the end and it also has cool Action scenes! This movie is good for people of all ages, and I really recommend it!
 Aryan K 	  Weird.. It seems joker and batman have a "gay" like relationship instead of " I love you " its "I hate you joker" "i hate you too batman" the joker part made no sense put for the story with batman and robin and batgirl relations are ok but its weird!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Theodore C 	  This was one of the most disappointing animated films in a long time. Similar to cars 2 (with the character Nader), Lego Batman takes the perfect sprinkle of a popular character ( Lego Batman) from the original film and overpowers the subsequent film with that character. It never gets good and in spots is uncomfortably bad.
 Bryan T 	  Not sure what movie everyone was watching but this was terrible. All the funny parts where shown in the previews. And just very corny.
 Trexler%20 C 	  understandably this movie is made by the same people by the Lonney Tunes would be making a upgrade to the lego movie and boost it's qaulity a lot.
 Olivia M 	  love Harley Quinn and the joker. great film.
 Ariel G 	  Bastante entretenida, muchas referencias al universo DC y otras pelculas clsicas de la cultura POP.
 Clarissa H 	  A great follow up to the immensely popular Lego Movie, The Batman Movie is actually one of the best films ever made depicting Bruce Wayne and his alter bat ego. The humor is well placed and easter eggs are all over the place! - Be still my nerdy heart - Both adult, child and nerd alike will get a kick out of Will Arnet's version of the Batman and the rendition put together by the same team that built The Lego Movie. Everything is awesome!
 Shawn B 	  This was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. It was a great time for the whole family. I would see it again and will probably buy it as well.
 Jason H 	  "The LEGO Batman Movie" is not just another kids film, and if you saw "The LEGO Movie" from a few years back, you know what you're about to get! It's well thought out, unbelievably silly and full of energy, and is loaded with life lessons (such as dealing with parental loss, or the not so simple blurred lines between good and bad) all making for a super fun and engaging cinematic experience. The animation is stunningly beautiful and exciting, and the riffs on the Batman comics and films over the years are the cherry on top (the way they look at the 60s Batman TV Series like it's some sort of bad drug trip is one of the funniest things). "The LEGO Batman Movie" is highly entertaining, and a perfect example on how to make a kids film about a toy brand without just focusing on selling the consumer something when it's all said and done. It's fun, and productive! Just like the toys themselves.
 Jack W 	  Self-referential, relentlessly entertaining and hilarious from start to finish.
 Josh G 	  it was OK was expecting a little more..
 Richard J 	  Had its funny parts but dragged on way too long
 Winter D 	  The movie was so funny i almost died of laughter. Love it You must see it before its gone.
 Dhamar M 	  Feels like a parody and it has its moments. But overall it's disappointing.
 Tiger L 	  Extremely entertaining, hilarious, original jokes, & possibly the funniest Batman movie ever !!!!!! 8.5/10
 Trevor L 	  Great time for the entire family. Definitely gets the job done of being extremely entertaining for both kids and adults. True Batman fans will have plenty of treats and Easter eggs for them to find and make the movie that much more interesting.
 Juji O 	  though slightly more directed towards kids, it doesn't cease to entertain any audience. it's a great movie for kids, I'm sure it'll be a lot of kids favorite movies, but it's nothing more than just a good movie for parents
 Andrew H 	  The first 15 minutes sums up the movie. The batman sarcasm and dry humor gets excessive without the rest of the cast from the original lego movie.
 Eric B 	  What I saw was brilliant however I probably slept through most of it. Incredible animation that pairs very well with my imagination as a kid playing legos. All Batman villains in one movie need I say more!
 Martha L 	  It was a very entertaining and hilarious movie with a good plot.
 Michael S 	  Funny movie, but not the greatest
 Mauricio P 	  Muy buen uso del humor que existe al rededor del personaje de Batman.Siendo una pelcula Lego, es an as una de las mejores obras de DC Comics en mi opinin.
 Manny R 	  Saw this movie 2 times its a funny and good movie
 PJ K 	  Well, not nearly as entertaining as the first movie. The batman character focus doesn't have enough depth to sustain the storyline for the length of the movie. It's like a subplot that has been stretched into a full feature. If you walked out of the first lego move humming 'everything is awesome' you will be disappointed.
 Ryan N 	  It was entertaining, but a lot of the comedy fell flat and seemed off. Lego Movie was definitely way better.
 Lucas B. S 	  I hope that the others Lego Movies don't be like that... ;(
 Edgar L 	  I loved it but not as good as the first Lego Movie
 Edward J 	  The LEGO Batman Movie is a wonderfully animated, smart, sharp, savage parody/satire of one of comics most beloved characters, his cinematic adaptations, and even his position in the cultural landscape. I know I'll be in the minority, but The LEGO Batman Movie is the best Batman movie since '89, or even the animated Mask of the Phantasm.
 Joseph J 	  i really do not like lego, you could definately tell that it was STOP MOTION
 Elias O 	  Genuinely funny. Doesn't try to be anything its not.
 Caroline L 	  One of the funniest kid movies I've seen. Love the humor!!
 Moore S 	  Nowhere near the original Lego movie. Yes, it is still very entertaining. However, most of the things that made the original film special, including the script and the soundtrack were entirely dismissed in this one. It's a one-time screening for me.
 Sulley I 	  OMG!!! this movie is so funny i watch it in michigan for vacation it was so fun to watch and i just sat there laughing the hole time
 Matt G 	  Lego Movie was a brilliant meta-commentary on childlike creativity. Lego Batman has less commentary, but is more just a straight product of that innovation, heavy on silly jokes and nerd references ("What am I gonna do? Get a bunch of criminals to fight the criminals? That's a stupid idea.") It's not the best Batman MOVIE, but it's quite possibly the most in-depth characterization of the Batman character. Even in the better iterations, he's a relatively flat character...not here. Not only is he hilarious, but he evolves.
 Bryce W 	  Funny, sweet and awesome.
 katie d 	  It is a really funny movie
 Cam P 	  Holy balls if ur a retard looking for some retarded thing to do then wank off to this atrocious BS. It's time to stop
 Brecken H 	  I loved it, even though I thought it would be too silly for me. It did a great job being very true to Batman, all the while making fun of everything super.
 Malikah T 	  My 9 year old son enjoyed it so I guess it was good. Lol
 Scott D 	  excellent fun fill movie
 Ravindra P 	  Kind of boring -- almost fell asleep one time! Too much of the Batman voice!
 Samuel%20 W 	  The Lego Batman Movie gives a Nostalgic yet entertaining comedic overflow to this franchise.
 Brandon W 	  Talk about a movie that started out as completely awesome, and not being able to hold on. The Lego Movie that came out three years ago worked extremely well because it appealed to both kids and adults. Kids were able to enjoy the bright colors, the action and some of the comedy while there were lots of jokes that adults could enjoy too. That was the tone throughout the entire film. The Lego Batman Movie, however, feels like it was split into two separate films. The first half was made for Batman fans. Not just any Batman fan, the ones who grew up on the Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney days of Batman. References here and there and all with great jokes. Then when the movie got going, you could tell that the writers were making this film for children. It was still enjoyable sure, but I just wish that the level of comedy was consistent throughout the entire film. Not having the first half made for the old school Batman fans and the second half just made for any kid under the age of 9. The messages seemed extremely forced and ultimately, it failed to keep me on the same level of interest as it did from the beginning. It started to lose me along the way. Overall, this is a great Batman film to show kids. I call it a "bridge-the-gap" movie. For kids that may not be old enough to watch a Batman movie with a Jack Nicholson Joker or a Heath Ledger Joker, Zach Galifianakis's Joker is a nice alternative for younger eyes. I believe that if I had a son, this would be a great film to take him to because he could enjoy it and I could introduce him to the world of Batman in a kid-friendly way. By this review, it may seem like I didn't this movie. I do, it's just not 91% good. Maybe a 75% good.
 Juan Diego L 	  Una pelcula muy entretenida, Batman es exactamente lo que quera ver, y los dems personajes hacen un buen papel. Me sorprendi que usaran muchos dichos y palabras colombianas, fue interesante pero al mismo tiempo raro y no me convenci. La relacin de Batman y Joker fue excelente pero el segundo acto es lento.
 Bobby C 	  While the film has a few flaws, Lego Batman is another worthy chapter in the Lego franchise. This 2nd successful film shows that The Lego Movie was not a one-hit wonder. Only time will tell if this franchise has the staying power of films like Despicable Me or Toy Story. Fans will not have to wait that long as The Lego Ninjago Movie will release this September. Lego Batman is a film that has a lot to offer for fans of Lego as well as fans of the Batman franchise. If you are a fan of either brands, I recommend seeing this film as soon as you can.
 Brandon%20 C 	  I liked it as a parody, but I thought it was quite boring. The message was nice, but I felt the story was rushed just to sell toys. I've looked at the lego sets they have, and they are in the movie for about 3 minutes.
 amelia c 	  this movie was better than the Lego movie. but it wasn't that good
 Jenabeth G 	  This movie was enjoyable, but it does not surpass the first Lego Movie and it's a see it once you're done kind of film. Definitely worth the watch for pure entertainment.
 Jenna G 	  For massive Batman fans that go beyond just watching the films, like myself, or even casual Bat fans....you have to see this. It's hilarious, of course, mostly because of the great voicework from Will Arnett. But holy shit, it's just a great movie to nerd out to. Not just the DC universe, but other popular franchises & their villains pop up. And it's nice to see a fun Batman movie to remind people how badass this hero is, when we've had a bunch of dark, gritty films and last year's less than great movie. And of course, to make fun of itself. Ultimately, it's a love story between Batsy and his favorite foe, The Joker. #IronManSux
 Ming Siu G 	  I don't know whether I saw too many trailers and clips, or I'm simply fatigued by Lego, but I did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would. Still, it's very amusing, with a very meta and clever LOL climax.
 Hayden S 	  He needs a lego penis.
 Shawn R 	  This was more of a pay tribute to all the previous Batman films and TV shows then a real story. It was entertaining and some good laughs.
 Josie T 	  Great movie for adults and kiddos!!! Funny and good
 Josh C 	  absolutely hilarious! not only 1 of the best movies of the year 1 of the best Batman films by far! go see this with the family sit back and laugh your ass off I sure did!
 Spencer M 	  Story is hilariously dramatic & cute, would watch mindlessly for years on end to please my kids.
 Arturo C 	  All the charm of the Lego movie plus the awesomeness of Batman!
 Mike I 	  Just like its predecessor, The Batman Lego movie was better than it had to be. It could have been a simple toy commercial but instead we get a quality family movie, a comedy, a critique of the Batman franchise, an adventure story, and a psychological examination of a man's inability to connect with others and how he overcomes it. And it works well. This is one of the best Batman movies ever. Yeah, I said it. I'd rather watch this over and over than "Dark Knight Rises" one more time. The Batman characterization in this movie is more spot on than it was in the last Nolan movie. Why can't the DCEU take its cues from this movie?
 Luis P 	  was a really good movie, love every minute of it and was as good as the Lego movie ??
 standingongiants92 . 	  Funny, but not quite up to the original
 Lance S 	  You don't need to be a Batman fan to enjoy this film. However, the more that you know about the character and his lore, the more you shall be thrilled by the film. The movie has wall to wall in-jokes about the iconic superhero. As a movie itself, there is excellent action, comedy, and a plot that unveils much more satisfying than some live-action productions of recent superhero films. Don't miss this gem of cinematic delight. Is it a 90-minute toy commercial? Yes. Is it a wonderful 90-minute toy commercial? Absolutely YES!!
 Jackelyn G 	  Some of the jokes are funny but some of them are more cliche and not creative lines on the script (this is for the Latinamerica spanish version)
 Myles H 	  Ok like Suicide Squad i was the most excited out of my step mom and step brother but UNLIKE Suicide Squad, this movie didn't disappoint at all. The animation was great,the jokes were great,the characters were great,everything was great. This movie go so fast that even some of the jokes and references go right over your head,there references and characters that even I didn't get. I guess if i had to point out flaws then I'll say the score isn't really good and the reason is that Batman himself has had lots and lots of music around him over the years and the score doesn't really take advantage of that. Also i would've liked some more emotional scenes(don't get me wrong there are some in here) but with Batman as a whole has a lot of emotion around him and I would've like the movie to take advantage of that just a little bit more.Those flaws aren't really BIG and the film is SOOOOO great that you can ignore them pretty easily. You gotta see this wether you're a Batman fan or not,i give it a 9/10.
 Quique S 	  Junto con la Triloga de Nolan, Lego Batman es una de las mejores pelculas de Batman que he visto.
 John S 	  Very much fun--even for and perhaps especially for adults. The only reason I took away a star is that the editing, particularly in the beginning is for folks with the attention span of a hummingbird and it may well give any folks over the age of 10 a headache.
 Petey W 	  My son loved it ????
 Dario R 	  Hilarious Batman flick...
 Jamel R 	  Who knew these LEGO movies could be so entertaining?
 kristina c 	  the kids loved it. also heard some patents laughing.
 Joshua V 	  Great movie, very funny for all ages. Just as great as the logo movie
 Mat B 	  Cringe level maximum.
 Gene M 	  Fast paced, heart felt, great characterization of batman. I loved the lines for adults, was the only one in the theatre that caught them. Have to pay attention!
 Joshua S 	  What makes Lego Batman so remarkable is how earnest it is. There has been much discussion of this movie trying to be a send up of the modern, darker and serious takes on Batman. But to me, it felt more self-contained than that. It merely tells a story about a self-absorbed egomaniac coming to grips with his need for a family and tells it well. It ends up being one of the most heartfelt and didactic children's movies this side of Zootopia. No, it doesn't have the twist or shock and awe of The Lego Movie. But it engrosses its audience in its surprisingly serious narrative all the same.Now, obviously I have a vested interest in this movie. Lego Batman is, in fact, the mascot of our humble movie blog. And Batman and his mythos is perhaps one of my favorite things ever, as many of you are PAINFULLY aware. However, it was actually the intelligent and deconstructive knife that The Lego Movie used that excited me for this picture. And there is more of the same brilliance here. Will Arnett plays the same obnoxious windbag that he did before. He follows a bit of an arc similar to Emmett from Lego Movie. The difference is where Emmett had to be umm...less stupid and clueless in order to evolve, Batman has to be less of a selfish, lonely jerk. Arnett knows how to play up comedic hijinks and dramatic moments quite fluidly and in his own off-beat way belongs in the pantheon of actors who have successfully given their own take on the Dark Knight. There is a crapton of voice actors who earn their pay in this one and I'm going to no doubt miss some. Michael Cera is an overeager and borderline innocent Dick Grayson/Robin who is desperately searching for a father. Ralph Fiennes is an excellent Alfred Pennyworth who really wants Bruce Wayne to grow the hell up. (Btw if this was live action you have to admit Fiennes is PERFECT casting for Alfred.) And Rosario Dawson impresses as a Barbara Gordon who is becoming the GCPD Commissioner and represents much needed change. And yes, the metaphor for Batman admitting that he needs Joker in the same way one would need a significant other pretty much nails the psychosexual angle of that 80-year-old rivalry on the head completely.The visuals likewise are beautiful and make you want to grab a ton of LEGO bricks and get to work. So yes, the marketing here works, but it's service to a better story than we deserve or need to be honest. The Lego Batman Movie will probably end up as one of the best children's movies of the year. I don't necessarily agree with a good chunk of the self-important jackasses on the internet saying that it's the best Batman movie since The Dark Knight or Batman 1989 or something, but it's a fine popcorn movie for everybody. And besides, the finest non-live action Batman movie to date is unquestionably The Mask of the Phantasm. But you knew that already.
 Andrew D 	  Dare i say this is better than the Lego Movie. It doesn't have the same goofy weird ending as the first and it never stops. It's constant but never in a exhausting way. I had a great time with it.
 JY S 	  Chris McKay directs alone, or does he, in The Lego Batman Movie.The 100 minute story speeds on through at a frenetic pace, without a whole lot of character build up. Vehicles are built, the phantom zone gets emptied, and villains are unleashed throughout the streets of Lego Gotham. There is enough to go around for kids and adults alike, with a positive message to go along with it.The Lego concept of the film works well, delivering amusing CG and colorful pieces, leaving an eye candy galore of a picture.The voice work deserves some praise with Will Arnett pulling off his Batman voice the entire time. Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, and Zack Galifianakis round out the major characters.The Lego Batman Movie is a successful example of a Batman story. Don't forget the password.
 Chuck B 	  The first 20 minutes are really funny, but slowly the movie drops off. By the end you just want the movie to end after it just tries to bang you over the head with the moral of the story. Overall it was much better than The Lego Movie and it had many more laughs. Kids will love it and adults will be able to tolerate it.
 Jack B 	  OMG SO AMAZINGI was laughing literally the entire movie, I would definitely recommend it for everybody.
 Mitchell C 	  This movie is somehow able to spoof and pay homage to earlier Batman movies and stories throughout the entire film. My only criticism is that the first 20 minutes of the movie are so great that the rest never reaches that peak again.
 Fabian C 	  Love it.. they used all the music, and customes.. really a good job, over the same way that Lego The Movie, this got a really undercover message.Totally recommended
 Karen V 	  Loved it. The jokes were spot on and if you didn't get some I'd suggest you do some research. Haha my brother didn't get the jokes too well so I had to explain the shark spray and the prince music. LEGO movies are the rage right now
 Randy B 	  Even fun for older adults due to all of the references to the old TV series.
 Chris F 	  This is great family fun! We took our 18 and 13 year olds and had a blast. The humor is clever and fun for several generations.
 Sam F 	  Great fun, and visually thrilling, if a bit too frenetic.
 Aaron M 	  Its not as good as the LEGO Movie, straight up. However it is still an extremely fantastic movie. Its very funny and not just for kids but jokes for the adults too. Its not as adult friendly as LEGO Movie in my opinion. It does get a bit repetitive towards the end but it has its morals and is highly recommended watch, still feels fresh. Just hope we dont get an influx of these movies.
 Andrea M 	  A great follow up to the Lego movie. I could watch a TON of these things and still have fun. Great comedy, and loads of great one-liners.
 Albie F 	  I liked how the Joker and Batman teamed up.
 Teddy S 	  Funny take on Batman, fun movie
 Jaime S 	  Great family flick. Funny from veginning to end.
 Al B 	  Funny but really stupid.
 Brandy C 	  I honestly had no intention of seeing this movie, but decided to anyways. I liked it. Not great, not terrible, but I did like it. I recommend give it a watch. Maybe not in theaters, but in general.
 Chris E 	  Wry funny. Great animation.
 Dustin R 	  best Lego movie so far!
 Cameron H 	  Good laughs, good references, and a good message. The scope of the universe they built in this one wasn't as expansive as in the original Lego movie, though.
 Alex L 	  Great movie to take your kids to! Great lesson for all in the end of he movie too! Well done.
 Winston B 	  Just as funny if not more so than the first Lego Movie. If you haven't checked out this movie or it's predecessor because you think they're just for kids, then you are truly missing out. The Lego Batman Movie is a blast from start to finish and it'll provide you with enough jokes to laugh at for over a year.
 Sam F 	  Funniest movie ever!
 David W 	  It may have a predictable plot, but The Lego Batman Movie is still an entertaining flick that makes fun of Batman and DC
 Aaron A 	  The Lego Batman Movie is huge fun for all ages. If this isn't able to put a smile on your face then simply have sense of humour. A very good watch indeed.
 Jack J 	  A solid effort, but it's no The Lego Movie!
 Eve D 	  Not a great follow-up to the original. best batman film from DC in years but not funny enough to follow the Lego film. you know it's not the same calibre when kids start running around playing after losing interest in the film after 10 mins
 Kevin L 	  A fun filled adrenaline shot of comedy.
 Justin E 	  Focused story, original, funny.
 Jamil M 	  Funny movie, just like the last lego movie.
 Meddie A 	  It was fun at the beginning, but a weak plot and keep repeating the same jokes all over made me dead bored of it ...
 Tristan P 	  The Lego Batman movie may not be quite as good as The Lego Movie, but it's still very funny and beautifully animated and serves as both a fun adventure movie for kids and a successful spoof movie for adults.
 Tyler H 	  Didnt even make is 15 minutes into the movie and we all walked out, such a terrible movie, fast paced and bad jokes....dont waste your money
 Kyle S 	  Fantastically animated and brilliantly hysterical, it's the best Batman film really since The Dark Knight. Go see it!
 Julia E 	  Meh. Good bits, but nothing of the witty banter and cleverness of the first.
 Teresa W 	  Funny and cute. It was ok.
 Molly C 	  This movie had it's one liners, but over it was horrible. I have no idea how it is rated so high!
 Michael S 	  A funny and smart follow up to the Lego Movie. Best Batman movie in years!
 Lily G 	  was this really aimed for kids? i don't thinkan average kid would get any of the jokes in the movie. i enjoyed it, it was a bit too busy at some points, but wasa good movie.
 William B 	  I had a ball of fun with flick! so zippy, quick, & fun to watch. Most the jokes land perfectly, & there's non-stop action, & great animation to keep everything moving. But, the 1st ones so great, this one doesn't quite live up to it. But, still Highly recommend for all! :) (8.8/10, B+)
 David B 	  not good. we like kids movies and this was worthless. Not terrible but does nothing for you. Half a star to dilute other people's ratings.
 John S 	  Great movie for the kids. There was a lot of adult humor that obly parents would pick up on. Very enjoyable.
 James W 	  Cute and funny, but runs out of steam about halfway through.
 Donna S 	  Love, love, love this franchise. It is possible to make a blatant excuse to bring in the merchandising money while also putting some effort into making it enjoyable.
 MajinJ  	  So hilarious and also has some really sad parts. Loved it. Great movie to see with family.
 Cole R 	  Another lego animated feature that entertains the audience and shows a great message. It's a funny and great film to watch with the family. Score = 9.1
 Charlie D 	  You have to be in the right mood to see this kind of film, unless of course you're under the age of 12. It's overzealous and cheerful personality can get on your nerves quite easily under the right circumstances. If you are in the right mood it's manipulatively amusing which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Thank god it at least wasn't accompanied by any utterly vexacious theme songs as that would've drastically brought down the quality of the film in my sense. Since another lego instalment is coming out later this year, I don't know how long I'll be able to ride the bandwagon till I'm completely turned off by it.
 Jimmy S 	  an amazing and fun experience
 Brennan C 	  Holly Macro Batman! This movie is awesome
 John G 	  The best Batman of all time!
 Sophia L 	  Good movie which kids will love. Lots of action and humor along with some relationship and socialization material.
 Juan G 	  Will Arnet is the Best Batman Ever
 Blackhawk z 	  I loved this movie guys it was truly a funny film and it just reminds me of how much of a kid I am I really enjoyed this movie and I think you guys will too.
 Mathew M 	  consistently funny and imaginative.
 Damon R 	  I loved it! I died laughing. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is what I love about it. Unlike Batman (the character), it has a heart. The Lego Batman Movie really stands out as the best DC animated theatrical movie since 1993's Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, except this is more of a comedy. An action-packed animated superhero comedy with a heart. So... let's put a smile on that face! I couldn't resist. Ha-ha-ha!
 Ramses A 	  Santas batipelculas Batman... Lego Batman
 John B 	  Not on the level of OG LEGO, but still a great family film that pays tribute to the dark knight
 Eric V 	  Not very funny. just a knock on the real batman which was not very funny. for very young kids. and the music was no where as good as the first one.
 Renzo Francisco B 	  me gusta la pelicula con mucho humor y accion q da esta pelicula con un contenido para nios
 Pavan K 	  Got to love this Batman
 Nick C 	  In a world oversaturated with superhero flicks, one hero will emerge from the ashes of DC's recent shortcomings to give fans a much needed breath of fresh air. This spin-off centered around The Lego Movie's Batman is a phenomenal take on the heavily idolized vigilante beloved by generations of moviegoers. Whether you're a fan of Michael Keaton's Batman, love the Nolan films, or your guilty pleasure is Adam West's portrayal of the iconic hero, there is something in this movie for you. Both director Chris McKay and the bevy of writers who worked on Lego Batman have an incredible understanding of not only Batman's comic book lore itself, but his various representations in film as well. This self aware parody is filled with nods and nuggets paying homage to Batman's legacy throughout the years that give all fans something to smile about. Although it stays true to its Lego based universe and incorporates some out of franchise characters, it still remains a superhero movie at its very core. For those willing to accept this tale of Batman as part of the character's ever-expanding history, it is easily one of his best adventures of all time. Though outrageously silly at times, the comedic pacing is immaculate. You're beaten over the head with an overabundance of jokes and background one-liners to the point that it's almost overwhelming. But then the film will seamlessly slow down to its prolonged humor as if the producers are simply waiting for you to laugh. The conversational dialogue would be enough to give a good chuckle, but the delivery by the star studded cast of voice actors is what brings it over the top. Zach Galifianakis as a whimsically sensitive Joker, Michael Cera as a giddy and jovial Robin, and Will Arnett's gravelly-voiced Batman added to the humorous tone while giving a new dimension to the much celebrated characters.The creative genius is also on full display with the amazing visuals . It may remain beholden to the Lego framework and mobility, but that does nothing to hold it back. Some of the action sequences in the movie have such a beautiful chaos to them with Lego bits flying around and vibrant colors shooting all over the screen that you almost get lost in the world they've constructed. At times it looks like it is straight out of a comic with large text like "BAM" and "POW" during a fluid fight scene, then the characters will "master-build" giant machines by throwing pieces together in what looks like it was taken straight out of the video game series. If you love Batman, love family friendly films, or simply want to get a good laugh, definitely go out and see this film. It's a unique take on the superhero genre that we should definitely expect more of.Score: 9.5/10
 Nick C 	  The LEGO Batman is one of the funniest and most entertaining animated films I've seen in 2017, and it's not only one of the best animated films of 2017, and one of the best comedies of 2017, but one of the best movies I've seen this year!
 Dely M 	  I was hoping to see a similar ending from the first installment (TM)
 Carlos D 	  finally! we get a breath of fresh air from all that serious darkish batman we've been watching for....almost 20 years!! Will Arnett's the best choice for this.Zach Galifianakis and Michael Cera did a great performance as well.very enjoyable funny and charming movie.I hope they don't ruin this Batman with a tv series,we're good with this kind of installment.
 Gabe W 	  It was funny. Dick Grayson did not have glasses
 Ben V 	  Batman and Joker relationship is really good. Definitely a Batman movie that is aimed at kids.
 Jordan H 	  good film kys rotten tomatoes critics dceu is cool
 Regina P 	  Hurrah! Fantabulous movie! Great lesson! Great soundtrack! Chuckled the whole way through .... no true complaints!
 C J 	  Funny. Like a 13 year old boy kind of funny. Wouldn't watch it again.
 tineshia a 	  This movie was not good. It was ok, but i won't be buying it on DVD for my kids. They were more excited about the preview of Cars.
 Gabriel M 	  Santo filme, Batman! ??
 Bonnie P 	  We've already seen it in the theaters...twice. Brilliant.
 Stanley C 	  This movie made Batman look like such a self-centered deranged jerk who only cares about himself which sets up a plot hole on how he chose to be a superhero in the first place, and I couldn't stand Phyllis or Barbara at all, those two were very annoying and keep constantly trying to blackmail Batman out of not being kept a prisoner of both of them.
 Colt A 	  this movie is amazing. the callbacks they make will delight the most hardcore of Batman fans, while not alienating the newer or more casual Batman fan. the message they offer is a great one for children to hear... and even caused a very meaningful conversation between my son and I about keeping your word as a man... eventhough it may result in the loss of something you hold dear. while this movies target audience may be children, it offers something for adults all throughout.. they achieve this in what I say is the more difficult way possible... they offer humor and references that are appropriate for the audience, and do not cram inappropriate humor or context into a children's movie.
 Niki L 	  This movie was brilliantly cleaver and funny.
 Tj P 	  Everything is awesome !
 Matthew C 	  Well, after the Lego Movie. Warner Bros. made another Lego Movie based on possibly the best DC Comics character ever to be created. I must say I loved the way how they play out Batman's character and if you do consider yourself a Batman Fan, then you will understand all the references in the movie to the past few Batman Movies. Although if you are a Hardcore Batman fan, you may wish that there was more to this movie, but for what it is ???? Go check it out and judge if for yourself, but it is really good.
 James P 	  THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE is one of the greatest satires and greatest animated films ever, and the finest superhero movie ever made.
 Samiran%20 B 	  Just what a Batman Movie needed.The script seems to full of trolls, puns and a lot of "Cause I'm batman".A full length enjoyment. Will Arnett (J.O.B) didnt do a hugh mistake.
 Cody K 	  Good overall. Funny and comical portrayal of Batman and Robin. Some jokes can only be understood by adults which I enjoyed.
 Mike M 	  One of the best Batman movies you'll ever see but everything is not quite as awesome as the LEGO Movie.
 Emmanuel H 	  Loved the movie almost as much as The Lego Movie. Lots of Batman and DC references and many criticism to superhero movies. It really made a great movie.
 Alex A 	  Visually, and world building-wise, The Lego Batman Movie is a triumph. Semi-obvious praise goes to the voice acting, self-satire and references to previous incarnations of Batman. The humor garners its hilarious moments, but there's misfires and occasional repetitiveness too. The inclusion of iconic villains outside of DC is both a pro and a con, as it's fun to guess who they are, while simultaneously causing the third act to feel bloated. Not to mention the runtime could've been trimmed a little. In many ways the little things accumulated give the film its charm, and The Lego Batman Movie is a creative, literal block-buster.
 Chris P 	  Well done, but frankly it's a geek fest overload
 Kel P 	  This movie was amazing! Fun from start to finish, although there's a noticeable slow down in the middle.
 Ciaran G 	  good start to the film but went boring after 30mins
 Freddie S 	  The Lego Batman Movie is the lego movie we deserved, and also the one we needed. It's the let's get nuts movie all batman films needed. It's the Batman vs Superman, only minus everything in the film, and plus awesomeness. Was it as good as The Lego Movie, not sure. However if you love Batman, or Legos, or Lobster, then you are in for a treat.
 Emmanuel S 	  'The Lego Batman Movie' is every bit as delightful and funny as it's predecessor, reliant more on its DC mythological background as less on toy building blocks to forward the story with hilarious results.
 Chris d 	  I will definitely admit that I didn't know how much I was going to like the movie considering that I kinda didn't like the LEGO movie but this however was a truly wonderful time at the movies I laughed out loud at least twice during the movie and really enjoyed the characters the story and adventure and of course the laughs yes BATMAN is a little cocky at the beginning of the story but he learned a valuable lesson about friendship and teamwork skills i suggest that you take the family and have a good time
 Lee A 	  Almost nonstop humor. Fun and very self aware, a great addition to the Lego movie cannon. Not so sure about the new Ninjago movie coming out though...
 Tyler A 	  Honestly this is the best DC movie since The Dark Knight. Funny and compelling story and solid animation
 Frank G 	  Funny, silly but ultimately smart, The Lego Batman ridicule/question the problem of the iconic superhero in the brightest tone possible.
 Jorge Luis I 	  Buena, buena para el fandome buena para todos.
 Rafael L 	  A fun parody within a great Batman story.
 Jei P 	  i love lego anything and Batman is my favorite hero so what could go wrong?!?!
 Jos M 	  La mejor pelicula animada del 2017
 Tony V 	  Had to go and see it a second time! Great family movie!
 Marcus M 	  It's hard to talk about Batman without letting my fandom take over, but seeing how LEGO Batman references so much Batman history; it's only appropriate to review it from a fan perspective. With that being said, "LEGO Batman" is by far my favorite Batman movie behind the original Adam West Batman. I loved "Batman Begins" and the "Dark Knight" but even those didn't keep me quite as entertained from opening shot to credits."LEGO Batman" is an encyclopedia of Batman knowledge,: from the laundry list of villains from comics and TV shows, to the marketing of Batman to kids in the 90s that included some of the most ridiculous Batman specialized action figures ( I'm pretty sure I had Arctic freeze batman s a kid). The unrequited love/hate plot between Batman and Joker is a hilarious play in their history as well. At first I was skeptical that the LEGO version would be geared too much toward a 10 and under audience, but was pleasantly surprised how well it translates no matter how long you've been a Batman fan. Even if it's your first Batman movie it sums up his whole mythology well enough that you could understand his past, and motivations. (Will Arnett) takes the character in a more arrogant and look at me I'm Batman sort of way but it works so well because you could easily see a billionaire playboy having an unhealthy ego, even that plays well in showing batmans solitude and loneliness.Simply put,this movie is amazing, and definitely the most fun I've had at the theater in a while. It's worth the full price of admission and I think seeing it on a small screen wouldn't do justice to the beautiful graphics this film has to offer. Grab your kids, your parents, your grandparents,friends, grab whoever and go see "LEGO Batman".5/5
 Samantha M 	  Don't get me wrong, this is no "The Lego Movie", but Lego Batman delivers a funny and self-aware family outing you shouldn't miss.
 Teanna B 	  A wacky, insanely imaginative ...wait is this a sequel? To the Lego Movie? To all of Batman's legacy? No matter, sequels often fall flat, but this is more like the Marvel films, where each film becomes an episode, or chapter in a long running series. Probably more actual character development than many live action Batman films, and for once it's a world you'd like to inhabit, not a grim grey apocalyptic mess. The fact that it is a Lego world adds a dimension of crazed creativity that even non-Lego users will appreciate. Only the most snobby comic fans will pooh pooh this. FUN! But with a core of what makes superhero stories work.
 Shane M 	  While the film has the same production quality as The Lego Movie, it falls with it's lack of imagination that the Batman IP cannot give.
 Ivan L 	  Very funny, runs out of steam a bit near the end but still very good.
 Ryan B 	  This movie focused too much on the serious side instead of humor. The Lego Movie was much better!
 Mike D 	  Very funny!! First 40 min is literally lol funny!!
 Amanda H 	  Once again, I was delightfully surprised. I couldn't stop chuckling throughout the duration of the film. I appreciated the modest heart-warming scenes as well.
 Alam V 	  Very enjoyable movie, no matter the age :D
 Robert M 	  The Lego Batman Movie is a deconstruction and celebration of the Caped Crusader. It's also the best Batman flick since 2008.
 K M 	  Fantastic!Hilarious. I love Will Arnett.
 Michael P 	  Another great Lego movie. A small step below the original Lego Movie (not much) but easily better than the last 3 Batman movies. Bring on Lego Ninjago Movie!
 Lynda M 	  Kids would probably give it a higher rating. As an adult it was ok, had seen some of the best parts in the trailer. It's loud and colourful.
 Mr. F 	  Funny ActionEnjoyableKid-friendlyThese are only a few adjectives to describe The Lego Batman MovieGreat movie 91% rotten tomatoes worthyI loved it!!!!!! YOU SHOULD WATCH IT!!!!
 Zheng Liang Y 	  worst 18 bucks spent
 Kristen D 	  I completely loved this movie. Highly recommend. Kids will definitely love it and so will adults.
 Michael T 	  It was a bit long but this Lego-ized Batman world carves the line between humor and seriousness that the DCEU should be taking inspiration from. It is coy, witty and pays homage to Batman's past cinema history as well as his place in pop culture today.
 John R 	  Very enjoyable with lots of amusing links to previous super hero movies. Good scrip and voices.??
 Melissa R 	  It was a bit good but not some best moments in the flim
 Joseph O 	  This movie was outroarously funny. I enjoyed watching every second of it. Great laughs throughout the film. Not a dull moment.
 Daniel V 	  The Lego Batman Movie is a delightful film that can be enjoyed by all ages. Will Arnett portrays the Lego Caped Crusader wonderfully, with his wittiness and overall narcissism. It's funny and fast-paced and is very much worth your time.
 Lucero C 	  Lego films continue to be excellent!!! so hilarious!
 Justin S 	  Great movie for all ages
 Linda B 	  An average 3.5 stars, but worth watching
 Chris B 	  When this film was first announced following the success of The Lego Movie I was apprehensive. Although I enjoyed Batman in the film I thought a whole film dedicated to just this character would be stretching it. Thankfully I was wrong. A treat for any Batman fan, there are jokes for hardcore and casual fans. The opening scenes were hilarious and although the jokes did dry up in the middle the laughs returned by the end of the film. My only criticism would have been that a lot of the jokes were in the multiple trailers, and the plot was quite obvious from the trailers as well. I enjoyed the multiple cross-brand characters (not split in advance) but did feel a bit like a mirror image of the Lego Movie's ensemble of Master Builders just evil.
 Daniel B 	  Lego Batman does everything it sets out to do. It's a fun ride, incredibly amusing and the animation is on top form. It's a fantastic tribute to the Batman legacy. DC films need to make more like this!
 David S 	  I loved this almost as much as the original Lego Movie. This film had me rolling with some hilarious jokes and callbacks to prior films and Batman's. The surprise bad guys we're pretty sweet too. This film is "for kids" but anybody can enjoy it. It has humor for all and its a really nice looking animated film. Lego Batman was awesome!!
 TomTom C 	  Another classic lego movie, please make 75 more these..
 Bruce F 	  A nice amount of humor for adults and an overload for the kiddos. Better than quite a few of the live action Batman movies.
 Tiffany R 	  I have seen this multiple times and it just keeps getting better. It's a very fun movie from start to finish.
 Reed V 	  Enjoyable for kids and those familiar with the polarizing cinematic history of the protagonist, but also somewhat long-winded and noisy.
 monica l 	  this movie is hilarious
 007 W 	  The lego batman movie is good, of course up there with the lego movie, thank Christ Warner Bros have made a good movie because they did a pretty bad job with DC in 2016, cause we've got Batman versus Superman and suicide squad or, they're both awful, but thank God this movie is good
 John M 	  Of course this is going to be the first 2017 release I watch. So if you couldn't figure it out by the title, this is Batman (Will Arnett) in LEGO form. He has to deal with his usual song and dance from the Joker (Zach Galifianakis), but he also has to face the repercussions from accidentally adopting a son (Michael Cera) as well as pinpointing the reason why he has always had the desire to work alone. If you happened to catch the original LEGO Movie back in 2014, one of the biggest takeaways is how good Will Arnett's voice is for the character of Batman. He may not have the build to play him in a live action, and he is too renown for being comedic to be cast in anything serious, so with LEGO, this may be his only chance. He thrives in this universe. After the mess that is Batman v Superman, this is a breath of fresh air. I love them, but the Nolan trilogy set the tone for this character to be exclusively featured in very dark stories. The creators of the DCEU went off of that, and they put together a universe that is not only drab and devoid of any sense of humor, but it seems to be against the law for anyone to crack a smile. This is the polar opposite of that. Now let me tell you that this is a movie that moves fast; I am fairly certain that I missed at least a dozen jokes if not more because I was still too busy laughing at the previous joke. It spreads the humor in such a way that there is something for everyone; there are simple jokes that kids will get, as it is very similar to them playing with their toys, but there are also tons of in-jokes so that if you know anything about the lore of Batman, you will get an appreciated nudge and a wink. There are jokes for film buffs as well, like a well placed Gymkata reference. There was even an Arrested Development callback that I totally missed until my wife explained it to me, and that is exactly what this movie is: so many clever jokes that are jam packed into the script that you almost assuredly miss a few. This is a movie that comprehends Batman better than anybody does in the DCEU. You could make an argument that this is all about marketing so as to sell toys, and while you're not wrong, this is so much more than that, much like the original LEGO movie. The villain lineup is impressive, and even though equal screen time obviously cannot be granted in a 100 minute kids movie, simply by mentioning all of these character names is a nod enough. Zach Galifianakis turns in great work as The Joker, which isn't something I can say that I was expecting; I'm really glad he chose not to just do a Nicholson or a Ledger impression, because it would have been wildly inappropriate. There is a ton of fan service, and if you like the character, this is a must see.
 Ken C 	  The LEGO once again recreate enthusiasm and inventiveness with wit, enthral and stream of funny jokes. Bum that the final act and the way the hero resolve his conflict familiar with the original LEGO movie.
 Jody T 	  I laughed so hard I was crying. As an adult. Great humor. Can't wait for Redbox to watch it again!
 Jay M 	  Of course DC has to put more homosexuality in kids stuff.
 Caspar N 	  LEGO Batman Movie was honestly a thrill from start to finish. I was engaged the whole movie and it hit the nostalgia I didn't know I wanted from previous Batman series. I will say the first ten minutes almost lost me, though. LEGO Batman Movie tried and, in my opinion, fell a little short of what Deadpool did with being self-aware of being a movie and breaking a lot of fourth walls because it doesn't really continue to do that. What did it for me is when they focused on Batman's trope through out all of the franchise which was him wanting to be alone to protect himself and others and realizing that he needs them to continue what he does. LEGO Batman Movie does it in a way, though, that continues to be humorous with its own meta jokes and hilarious dialogue. I found that the jokes never really missed a beat and had being me laughing most of the movie. There were very few instances where I thought the plot dragged or that joke was running too long. It's perfect for kids who might not understand all of the back story because of the action and humor but still great for adults who do.
 Jonandrey S 	  Creative,Great and a Successful Lego movie that is enjoyable to watch full of action,pack,and many more..
 Matt B 	  This was funny and very entertaining. Though I did enjoy the Lego movie slightly more this was a fantastic addition to the series. I never expected both films to be any good but after learning the director came from robot Chicken I was immediately interested. just like the show it plays into the films with similar satire theme to which adults and kids will both enjoy. Will Arnette is a talented comedian and does a great job voicing Batman. From beginning to end the movie never loses steam. I highly recommend this film it's worth a watch. Can't wait to see more Lego movies!
 Basil D 	  This is a great batman movie with legos, it does what animated films should, it is funny and exciting.
 Gael C 	  This is a wonderful look at the Batman story focusing on a side that most Batman movies show in a heavily dramatic way, but Lego Batman Movie plays it in the most comedic way possible. Which is both the positive and negative of this movie. It is a very funny and cute movie with very funny joke being thrown at you at every second. Which at times gets a little tiring.Still a very recommendable movie for both kids and adults.
 Eric M 	  A little exhausting but absolutely hilarious with a great message and great cameos.
 Corey V 	  Pretty great successor to The LEGO Movie
 Rachel B 	  Got old really fast. Animation is stellar and it's still a pretty fun film but doesn't hold a flame against Lego Movie.
 Gregory C 	  Yes. Yes. Thank you, yes! <3
 Lee M 	  Good movie for my son & I but seemed a little strung out.
 Trey B 	  Fun and funny time indeed!
 Teddy F 	  A fun movie with above average visuals and animation, several jokes throughout, and a new and unique take on the Dark Knight. The only problem it runs into is some forced humor here and there. Otherwise, Lego Batman is good for Batman fans of all ages and is better, I think, than its predecessor, The Lego Movie.
 Mirella R 	  This movie was ridiculously boring I had to sit for 2 hours and it did not catch our attention one bit
 Laura C 	  I loved this movie! This movie was so funny! I saw this movie with my mom and we both laughed threw the whole movie we really enjoyed this hilarious movie! I love Batman!! If your a fan of Batman and Lego movies you will love this movie! This movie is great for adults and kids too very funny and age appropriate! go see this movie!
 Jason R 	  Probably the single best Batman movie ever made. It has no restrictions, and can be exactly what it is, a wide open, fun romp through the Dark Knight's world. There are great little touches that reference both some of Batman's craziest villains(Condiment King), and his regular villains(Bane's voice is the Tom Hardy/Dark Knight Rises version). Zach Galiafanakis was a genius choice to portray the Joker, and launches himself into the pantheon of great portrayals of that character. He would be a great choice for a live action portrayal, as well.The movie goofs on a lot of things, and plays up things like Batman's inability to form meaningful relationships, and the innocence of young Dick Grayson, as well as Joker's need to be considered Batman's greatest villain. It has a lot of fun, pulls no punches whatsoever, and is full of terrific laughs for both the kids and the adults.Batman is regarded by DC and the DCEU, DCAU, etc. as a serious and brooding character, and as such you will never see something like this in their mainstream universes, which is why this movie stands out as refreshing, and gives all these characters an opportunity to be funny without necessarily being campy. The plot is good and solid, and hits its marks while leaving a message for its youthful audience, and as a result it succeeds in ways its film versions have failed over the years. So grab the kids, get some popcorn, and enjoy, because this is the Batman movie you never knew you needed.
 Adam H 	  Hilarious. I now officially love the lego movie franchise.
 Brian B 	  Great movie! Pros: Great humor, fan service, and various characters! Cons: Hero-villain relationship drama. That part made it seem like batman and joker were ex gay lovers.
 Rowan W 	  Havent seen it. Still better than batman v superman.
 Paul R 	  The Lego Batman Movie is a joy to watch from start to finish and it is as much for adults as it is for kids. Witty, inventive and visually stunning to look at, it's up there with some of the best animated films of recent years. Will Arnett plays a great Batman, a combination of the past incarnations and he adds his own sarcastic touch too. The film works on so many levels and the fun and homage that it pays to previous Batman films is what I liked the most. There are references to the Michael Keaton Batman films, Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy, as well as making fun of the Adam West tv series and the god awful Joel Schumacher atrocities. There are also lots of really fun Superman moments that I really enjoyed too. It's great fun from start to finish, it moves along at a great pace and doesn't outstay it's welcome. I look forward to a sequel.
 Max D 	  Its a good batman "Parody" movie, and it gets you entertained but there is so much laugh that is tired..
 Javier S 	  Una historia super divertida acerca de la relacin de Batman y Robin con un guin que toca muchsimos de los puntos importantes de la historia de Batman y que convierte esta pelcula no slo en una buena pelcula de Batman si no en una buena pelcula en general muy recomendable?
 Allen W. H 	  Clever writing and entertaining. A fun movie. :)
 Chris H 	  Let's not beat around the bush here, this movie is fall off your chair hilarious. And outside the Dark Knight, this is the best Batman movie that's been produced. Flavors of the Lego movie throughout, but it sublet and tastefully done. Must see, you won't regret.
 Dan D 	  Worst of the worst. Waste of $50!matinee.
 Cortney S 	  Probably the greatest movie I've seen in the past year. Hilarious and witty from the intro credits to the end credits. And tons of references
 Ted W 	  Great Lego animated movie that's sorta a spin off of the lego movie starring will Arnett, Michael cena , and Rosario Dawson. Going into this movie I thought it would be a cheesy kids movie but actually had a lot of heart in this movie and the moral just makes you appreciate your family or the people that are close to you. Yes , this movie is cheesy at times but you have to put in your mind that it's a kids movie so they have to put those butt jokes in the film. Another thing that was awesome was the cameos and references in this film like gremlins, the wicked witch of the West, count dracula, Jurassic park, king Kong, and Godzilla. That's just my favorites but their are many many other cool references. Last thing, the jokes and how Barham breaks the 4th wall and uses all the Batman movies to his advantage and makes fun of them and turns into something hilarious. Can't wait for another Lego movie, so far they haven't disappointed me.
 Darren P 	  It's not quite on the same level as The Lego Movie, but there's a lot of fun to be had for all ages.
 Alex B 	  Probably the best depiction of batman we'll get all year
 Ryan V 	  This has the same sense of humor and pop culture references as The Lego Movie. And that's a great thing. It's also a big wet kiss to longtime Batman fans, complete with references to every preceding Batman comic, tv show and movie. I had a smile on my face the entire time.
 Blake W 	  Because I'm Batman!!!
 Pierre-Luc G 	  Un excellent divertissement. Idal pour ceux qui se cherchent une simple comdie sans prise de tte. Un joli contraste  l'univers DC et ses nombreux hros un peu trop srieux.
 Miranda M 	  Con un mensaje super especial y la accin no termina...realmente me gusto mucho!!
 Chris V 	  Pretty dang funny. The voice actors are hilarious especially Michael Cera.
 Peter C 	  Wasn't as good as the Lego movie but funny non the less
 Santiago D 	  Hilarious! It is literally a parody of every superhero movie and it is GENIUS!
 Damon P 	  Fun and great for kids I really liked this movie
 Neil P 	  This was a joy to watch - not as clever as the Lego movie (which is a surprisingly high bar) but possibly funnier and incredibly rewarding for fans of Batman in film/tv/comics (which I am). In many ways it does a bigger story than any of the Bat movies have attempted and it has a really good take on Batman and Jokers "relationship". Will Arnett is simply great as Batman and I get the impression he loves the role always manage to balance the fine line between loveable jerk and pain in the ass. Teaming him with his "arrested development" co-star Michael Cera as Robin is a great idea too. There's too many geeky shout-outs to listen and most of the film is laugh out loud funny. The lego animation is also distinct and visually interesting throughout. Based on the Ninjago trailer, I'm still dumbfounded how the Lego film franchise might be the freshest out there at the moment.
 Jason S 	  Not near as good as the original Lego movie.
 Elton G 	  The relentless visuals and jokes may wear you out, but if they do not, this movie is a super funny film filled with good characters and a lot, a lot of references.
 Tony K 	  Fun and enjoyable. Moves quickly. great voice talent. Wish they didn't add the non-dc characters. Also wasn't a fan of the Joker but everyone else blew me away. The jokes were more for us grownups. not in adult related but they pulled from our past with the older batman movies and tv shows.
 Eric B 	  Great movie with lots of in-jokes for Warner Bros. fans.
 Mitchell B 	  Maybe the funniest animated movie I've ever seen
 Dashtag M 	  Super cute and silly!
 James J 	  This was exactly good and it was funny.
 JGAMER  	  an ACTUAL FUNNY SPOOF movie! This movie is a spoof movie, but it knows how to be one unlike anyother spoof movies ive seen. It has perfect comedy for adults and kids to laugh at and it keeps you entertained all the way through with action to the point where it gets exhausting, which is good. If your looking for a movie for the whole family to enjoy, then this would be the one! There is something about these lego stop motion movies that is super cool to see on the bigscreen that I would actually buy this on blueray!
 Luis Henrique R 	  Muito legal!!!No  o melhor filme do Batman..no  o que eu quero ver em Live-action, no tem a essncia do personagem, pois ele tem quase 80 anos e vrias interpretaes ...parece um filme do Joel Shumacher...mas  FODA DEMAIS!!!Da para gostar e ver qualidades em tudo, mesmo quando aquilo  diferente do que vc mais gosta do personagem ou segmento."Se voc quer fazer do mundo um lugar melhor, olhe para si mesmo e faa uma mudana....Uhu Batman ou Michael Jackson
 Chris C 	  sometimes it's so dumb it's funny
 Stephen N 	  It was too funny NOT too be good! Forget about the Lego movie; see this gem!
 Cesar Q 	  Funny, thoughtful and amazing graphics. It just lacked the ingenuity and heart from the first Lego Movie.
 Ryan M 	  The Lego Batman Movie is more than just a hilarious send-up of superhero movies-- it's also a really good superhero movie, standing tall among the best Batman feature films by capturing the important components of all Batman eras, which no other film has done to date.
 Scott C 	  Good rainy Saturday movie, lots if laughs.
 B C 	  If you liked the Lego Movie, then you'll like this one.
 Humberto R 	  Very Funny movie; Batman has his own solo adventure in Gotham with all his villains gallery; with really brilliant moments; he is commenting the credits at the beginning as usual; lots of irony with DC, WB, Superman & Marvel; lots of cameos (WarnerBros, other franchises & Sci-Fi); a lot of jokes, gags, parodies; Batman mocks Robin's real name LOL, what a cruel name for a kid; Superman having a party in the fortress of solitude with all the Justice League members & Batman wasn't invited; this is a movie for freakies; Bruce Wayne is irreverent; a small part of Arkham is boring; DCComics laugh at theirselves; this film has a message: you have to embrace the family that was given to you; an epic ending & emocional, a.worthy ending for the bat; a movie like Sausage Party but made for family, Deadpool laughing at everything and breaking the 4th wall; great music, homage; lighting, colors, textures are great, a technical evolution since the last film, it's visually more attractive. One of the best of the bat.
 Dyron W 	  What guy didn't want to be Batman growing up? He had the badass suit, the gadgets, the cool assortment of vehicles such as the iconic Batmobile, vast wealth, public admiration (more so in the Bruce Wayne persona), physical prowess and intellect to aid him in his war on crime. He's the man, he's the epitome of awesomeness. And you wanna know who else knows this although to a fault? The Caped Crusader himself in the fun-filled spin-off to the breakout hit The Lego Movie, which gave us our first appearance of the cocky and boastful mini-figure-rized version of the DC Comics superhero/Master Builder. Will Arnett once again lends his hilariously (and naturally) gruff vocals to the crime fighting glory hound Batman who has everything but a family to hold dear and find solace with, but that all changes when his unknowingly adopted son Dick Grayson stumbles upon his secret life and he is forced (by his butler Alfred) to take him under his wing as he races to stop the Joker's diabolical plot while learning to a team player. Just like The Lego Movie, this film is a visual treat built (no pun intended) on imagination and sight gags. After seeing the various worlds of the previous film on display, it was equally astonishing seeing Gotham City in Lego form and this interlocking world of colorful bricks, figurines and illuminating plastic fire/laser beams, etc. leaves a lot of creativity for the animators to work with and continues The Lego Movie's Master Builder theme by having Batman assemble a multitude of objects/vehicles on the fly just by using the environment around him. The technique adds a lot more to the cool factor as well as the laugh factor as the film goes along and makes the possibilities with the constructed tools, vehicles and characters themselves endless. Arnett scores as Batman, who continues to inject life, humor and even heart to this self-absorbed, frat bro take on the character, who prides himself on his heroism, loves the spotlight and wants to think that he can function alone whether on the job or at home (where he still wears his cowl and watches nothing but rom-coms all to himself) and seeing the excited Dick/Robin (voice by a rarely energized Michael Cera) tag along with him and turn him around was sweet in itself. Additionally, Zack Galifianakis' Joker is a ball of fun as his attempts to get the Caped Crusader to accept him as his greatest foe comes across like a jilted lover-type story, something I always wondered about him in the cartoons and comics. These characters possess solid story arcs that convey how important family and friends are and to never take a good thing for granted. The Lego Batman Movie is a endlessly entertaining feature that will engage kids and adults alike with sharp meta humor, several nods to the Batman mythos and impeccable voice talent.
 Andrew B 	  Not a kid's movie but then not an adult's movie either, no wonder it's No 1 at the box office.
 Justin M 	  It was fun. I loved it. Great Batman movie that knows how to laugh at itself.
 Raheel k 	  This was a surprisingly entertaining film. I know it's been getting rave reviews, but I'm somebody who typically likes my batman dark and brooding. I think there's a place for comedy in superhero characters/movies, but not as much with batman. Although now that I think about it, I did like Batman Brave and the Bold as well, so I guess I do like a comedic side of Batman. Anyways this story was a more comedic take on Batman maturing and understanding that he needs the help of others to hold on to his humanity. That living and working in isolation is not sustainable and that having allies makes him a better person and hero. I enjoyed several aspects of this movie, not the least the homage to almost every other Batman film or tv series created. The montage in the begiing taking us through he various incarnations of the movie Batman was hilarious. As was the joke about Superman being Batman's number one enemy. I also loved that the references went beyond just Batman and that the WB referenced several of their classic movie franchises, including the monster series they are working on, King Kong, Harry Potter, and even the gremlins! This movie was a blast and I look forward to the next Lego movie. The previous two have been incredibly enjoyable!
 Matt H 	  I thought it was pretty funny. I think the Lego Movie was better.
 Mike H 	  I suppose I went in with my expectations too high. It didn't have the heart or imagination of the first Lego movie. That's 2 maybe even 3 disappointing Batman movies in a row now.
 Francisco C 	  OMFG what an awesome mashup!!!
 Byron D 	  movie was slow, just Batman babbling all movie. my kids hated it. most if the parents and kids left before it was over. terrible movie
 April P 	  I cannot imagine how anyone couldn't like this movie. I'm 40, thought it was hilarious...went with an 11 yr old, she was laughing at 98% of the movie. Kid behind me was laughing so hard I was starting to worry about his wellbeing. It also has heart...but isn't sappy. I know I didn't get all the references and Easter eggs, just makes me want to see it again to find more. Just a great fun movie everyone will find something to love about.
 Paul F 	  After three years, Warner Bros. is finally bringing us back to the Lego universe in the glorious form of Batman, the best DC superhero (don't contest me on that: don't forget that he beat Superman last year). And despite being fairly cheesy and lacking subtlety, like its predecessor from 2014, it holds its own as a solid, funny, family-friendly second romp through the world of plastic bricks.The Lego Batman Movie tells the story of, well, Batman... obviously... and his life as a world-renowned, popular superhero stopping Joker (and every other conceivable Batman villain) in a Lego version of Gotham City, while also following his life as a lonely billionaire in Wayne Manor. He is joined throughout the film by other popular characters from the Batman lore, including Dick Grayson (Robin), a young orphan whom he accidentally adopts, Alfred, and Barbara Gordon (Batgirl). The plot in this movie is, understandably, something unlike anything we've seen in any Batman movie in the past, focusing heavily on both Batman's personality and character flaws and an absurdly over-the-top, and hilarious, showdown with the Joker. It's a fun time, to say the least, and one that I imagine will keep every kid, and most adults, entertained for its 90 minute runtime.The film is, overall, everything I would expect out of a Lego movie, given the way its predecessor set up the Lego universe a few years ago. First of all, it's gorgeously animated, this time seamlessly mixing non-Lego pop culture references into its brick-by-brick animations. Second of all, it's incredibly funny, incorporating a blend of humor that any-aged audience will be able to laugh at. Third of all, it is very over-the-top with its inclusion of pop culture lore. It makes frequent references to Batman's past in the film industry, features many other characters from the DC universe, and even features characters and copyrights from entirely different fictional universes altogether. It's not something you see often in movies, and it's something that made the film all the more entertaining. Finally, it tries hard to shove life lessons into the faces of everyone watching, kind of like the first Lego Movie did. However, it's a lot less subtle about it this time around, making it more of a tool to teach something to the kids watching. And while I understand the studio reasoning behind it, it takes away from the film for the adults in the theater.The Lego Batman Movie proves itself a worthy successor to its 2014 counterpart. It's smart and funny and beautiful all at the same time. Granted, it's not perfect (as I like to believe the first one was), due to its genuine lack of subtlety. However, it's overall a fun movie for kids and adults of all ages, and one I can see myself watching again in the future. Now let's pray that The Lego Ninjago Movie keeps up Warner Bros.'s winning streak. The Lego Batman Movie gets 4/5 stars.
 Oswaldo G 	  This movie was funny and had a lot of comic references. The action was good and the moral and lesson was great and it relates to almost ever Bateman film.
 Kevin F 	  DC Extended Universe & Batman's Highly-Polished AscensionThe Bat-Man/Bruce Wayne-created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, DC Comics member, and regular sentinel of Gotham City-, the esoteric nocturnal hero and philanthropist multimillionaire, has appropriated immeasurable designs, natures, dimensions and idiosyncrasies, from his roots in The Case of the Chemical Syndicate of Detective Comics #27 (1939) to his neo-appearance in Batman V Superman.Despite his initial salutations to the small or big screen were not entirely effective, his eruptive pinnacle ran from the pencil and the paper, comics which years later serve as required look for any tiny brilliant mind that longs to represent in a celluloid to the bleak superman without superpowers.Finite have been those who have portrayed his being truthfully, some with more artistic fate than others, with the general objective that the dark knight is globally singled out by his impenetrably complex and individualist moral, a man darkly martyred as a result of a fateful infancy.Nevertheless, LEGO, Danish line of plastic construction toys, which ventured into the cinematic market a few years ago, elaborated a subversive and radically antithetical transformation of that guy from Gotham contused of pompous manner; its version is critically fun, erratic and empathic, causing a partially unused aspect in the world of superhero movies. First, we are going to contextualize. It all started in 2014, the period in which Warner Bros. -it has Detective Comics's audiovisual rights-commended in the hands of, at that time, newcomers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, an avid and daring ambition focused on LEGO playful construction toys, company known worldwide. Luckily, it proved to be an unsuspected and festive strangeness, encountering us in front of an animation vehemently divergent from Pixar's or Dreamworks' works and a jaunty exclusive nature, which allowed our star character, his pertinent and unprecedented spin-off. So once again, they have hit the nail on the head, considering that the filmmakers do not enclose their aspirations within the vast editorial catalog of characters which they treasure, but that they redouble the desires doing to parade characters from other franchises such as "Harry Potter" (Voldemort), "The Lord of the Rings" (Sauron) or even apocalyptic primate "King Kong".The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, The World's Greatest Detective, Bats, The Bat or simply Batman is an individual who works and lives alone on the basis of his preconceived general statutes. He coexists behind the shadows of his alter ego: Bruce Wayne, who, rationally, also saves the world on an individual basis and without any vestige of changing his ways of thinking or acting. However, when he circumstantially adopts Dick Grayson, a sweet orphan boy, will be faced to forsake his existential ideologies and aphorisms in order to take it upon himself to bring him up, instruct him and convert him into his personal co-worker Robin. On the way, only a few are designated for adorning and supplying personality to the storyline; Barbara Gordon and his conservative butler Alfred Pennyworth will have to overcome the dodge manufactured by the fateful Clown Prince and all his clan of subordinates, which commonly threaten to the full extinction of the human race, nevertheless, this time goes much beyond.It's difficult to believe that the singular motion picture comes out minutely unscathed, having in its writing the bizarre amount of ten screenwriters, and though four of them set up Batman's (Will Arnett) and Superman's (Channing Tatum) brand new identities, that mishmash of ideas could have developed a creative incontinence which would finish with the absolute collapse of the product, but nonetheless, here, ten heads think better than one, and in a fabulous way.Although visual gags (slapstick), jokes and self-references are quite and even excessive, exactly that is what it is all about, presenting a fable with atypical and self-parodic touches exhorting contemporary society from macabre politicians, self-centered celebrities and barbarian conflagrations, a world where good and evil are so laughable to provoke a reaction and an understanding of our existential one-sided basis: love.Hence the script of these men is utterly about human affections; accepting that each human must open its heart understanding that each of them reason singly, assimilating their reasonings, respect and go forward, and support each other. It's more than a concomitant pop-culture product, is an evident social criticism requiring of compression within every child and adult who attend a movie theater. Pushing into the background a prudent analysis about soundtracks, dubbing or ideal characters, ethics and human morality are what take precedence; and although this specific vision will be merely appreciably for those who generate an abstract reading of the film, Hollywood, the fabulous cinematic monster, did not provide a work of such high-minded dimensions in a long time. This is the film we need, it's a must-see animated motion picture.
 Paddy M 	  Super fun. Super cool. Just super all over.
 Ian H 	  Spectacularly funny, uplifting, and heart felt.
 edgar r 	  Me Gusto tiene una muy buena mezcla de personajes como toda pelicula tiene sus defectos pero a muchas personas les encanto de eso estoy seguro
 Vicki M 	  Too violent for a kids movie
 Kwame O 	  I saw it in 3D and didn't like that to much but very enjoyable and I am 22 so check out
 David T 	  I saw this with our grand-babies. They loved it but I thought it was boring and not as clever or entertaining as previous Lego movies.
 Javier C 	  Very Good Message. I love This movie not so much like the first lego movie but is right there. loved the Jokes, The Music, specially the Humor of Batman. This is a family movie but the mayority of kids will not understand the jokes, teenagers will. But this is a very Recommended movie if you wanna laugh, is random and has to manny movie references for geeks or people who watch a lot of movies, but still you will enjoy it. See this movie.
 Kenny M 	  My opinion: rent it.
 Liam J 	  I absolutely love this movie. And it's jokes!
 Eric R 	  It was pretty fun, kept a good pace, had lots of funny/irreverent cultural references/in jokes, and overall kept to the same spirit as the original Lego Movie. But I don't think it was able to hit the same magic as the first one. Good popcorn movie. Overall fun.
 Troy A 	  I knew it was a good movie before I went to see it. I would pay to see it again! It was hilarious the entire movie ! I never expected that from a Lego Movie.
 John Ross D 	  Awesome in so many levels. Funny and fearless were the best describe of its gleeful humor that balances between the levitation of action sequences. Playful but there will be a point where everything alterates in a dramatic heart-felt manner. In some ways, it is tiresome to watch a blow-by-blow humor thrown off in every scene. But hey, it is quite nice to see a spoof movie that is worth the spent on & serves much quality from what it's spoofing on with.
 Olfa K 	  Too fast going not as funny as I hoped it will be.
 Ashish K 	  Noodles & Company, Idylwood Plaza, 7511 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22043
 Kaden K 	  This movie is honestly genus. I personally like it a bit better than The Lego Movie because of it's wit and great characters. The movie handles a great amount of villains and really isn't overwhelming! I cannot explain how funny this is until you watch it and almost guarantee to at least like it!
 Emma Lee C 	  Very funny, clever jokes, spectacular animation, intriguing story, & such a good moral for children that no matter how better a person can be by themselves, they still need a family, or anybody.
 Parker D 	  one giant easter egg
 Donnie B 	  It's a bit of forgettable fun.
 Linda E 	  Fabulous for kids and adults. Some truly terrific scenes for adults and the wonderful references to all heros and villains. Really great!
 Matt H 	  great movie!! not quite as funny as the Lego movie but I still enjoyed it a lot!
 Neal F 	  A better title might have been" Bat Guano"...and usually I like this stuff. Well, at least my little brother liked it.
 Paul B 	  It doesn't hit the same heights as the Lego Movie but fans of the caped crusader are going to revel in spoof as it pays reference to the Dark Knight through the ages, from the camp 60's to the current brooding portrayal we see in cinema's today. And any film that pokes fun BvS and Suicide Squad earn extra brownie points from me.
 Grant F 	  Though not quite reaching the heights of its Lego predecessor, The Lego Batman Movie excels as it understands the lore and the character himself, better, dare say, than the current batch of live-action movies do.
 Batman_Robin  	  This movie was loved by some, but I don't see it. I know this is supposed to be a kids movie, but this is just dumb. Batman RAPS. I was cringing the whole time. As a huge Bat-family fan, I was disappointed in more than one way. Barbra is almost like Batman's niece in the comics/shows, not his crush, and I found it kind of disgusting when I looked back on Batgirl and Nightwing. Why didn't Zod come out of the Phantom Zone? I just don't understand this movie, or why everyone thought it was so funny and entertaining, while I found it annoying and unfun. This was a wasted opportunity for a great Batman AND kids movie.
 Darryl J 	  I wanted to like this movie... It simply lacks the cleverness and humor of the Lego Movie. Most of the jokes fall flat and the plot wasn't inspiring. The best parts of the movie are showing in the previews yet when you see them in film it wasn't a satisfying trip to the theater for me. Any smaller kids who saw the Lego Movie will probably like this one - for me it was not entertaining.
 Danielle W 	  Best movie this year
 Juan M 	  The best Batman treatment in a major motion picture since, well, ever. Nolan's Batman didn't even get as much 'right' about the Batman concept as Lego Batman. Terrific.
 Fevzi I 	  Just too good for a supposed "kids movie" which the kids will of course love. The D.C. Comics cinematic universe is right now pale in comparison (and I really wanted to like Batman V Superman)...they need to take a few notes and see we want the live action films to be as deep yet still fun as this one.
 Wayne K 	  Having been a huge fan of The Lego Movie, and being excited to see which direction the inevitable franchise was going to take next, it came as a huge delight to discover that they were going with quite possibly the films stand-out character: Lego Batman, a man so selfishly preoccupied with being a brooding, crime-fighting vigilante that pretty much every self-serving thing he does is laugh-out-loud hilarious. It has all the colour, energy and verbal wit that The Lego Movie had, though perhaps without quite as much charm or raw heart, and crams a metric tonne of jokes into its 104-minute runtime. The pace can be an issue, as many scenes are so fast that it's nigh-impossible to decipher everything that is going on, but part of the reward is rewatching it and discovering how truly multi-layered it is, with many gags hidden sneakily in the background. The voice acting is fantastic, the story, while obviously silly, is engaging throughout, and it always finds time to deliver its comforting message about family and unity. If you didn't like Lego Movie this certainly won't change your mind, but for the rest of us it's a treat for the eyes, the ears and the soul.
 Joel C 	  way better than I expected not only a good keep movie but a pretty good batman movie
 David H 	  Was expecting Lego movie quality. Instead, this is pure formula and tries too hard to endear itself to the audience. It's not bad, but it's not above average either.
 Harvey R 	  First off, I think it is hilarious that even DC themselves have turned to bashing on Suicide Squad. Second off, this movie is amazing. It is like Bojack for children! Satire 101 for the kids, fun for the whole family. There was honestly no dull moment in the movie and all voices were hilariously well done. I can not help but wonder how they picked their targets though, just the most famous rom coms in general? Oh well. Regardless, thanks to Will Arnett, DC gets some major points back after SS. And thanks to Zack Galafanakis, the joker is redeemed.
 Daniel M 	  Good, fun movie but not quite on par with the first Lego movie.
 Jeff W 	  Fun, creative, and engaging.The beginning felt so silly and whimsical that I didn't think I would be able to emotionally engage with it, but the beginning is actually a clever approach to lay the character-building groundwork for Bateman that becomes the driving force of a great story.
 Austin W 	  What a disappointment. This movie was so funny until about one fourth or so into the movie. It started as just a fun, funny, parody for all ages, then one forth about into it, it turns into just a little kids movies, not as many clever jokes and repeat of jokes from earlier. By the last act it just wasn't funny. The worst part had to be, is the fact they keep saying the message of the movie over and over and over and not even try to be subtle. Every moment the lesson is learned by the characters, the characters for some reason have to learn it again and again. Loved thr first forth or so, but wow did it let me down.
 Diane E 	  Great kids movie! The grandchildren really enjoyed it!
 Charles C 	  Well worth every moment. The detail, the story, and the satire made this by far the best movie I've seen this. Aside from the fact I brought my 3 small children, whom loved it by the way, this is a movie adults of all ages can enjoy. I look forward to watch it a second time just to try and pick up some of the small details I undoubtedly missed in my first screening.
 Rodolfo A 	  Lego Batman is awesome.
 Scott W 	  A lot of fun and laughs !! Ha
 Chris G 	  Colorful, emotional, and most importantly of all, FUN, The Lego Batman Movie knows what it is and, despite its' minor flaws, more than makes up for it by keeping you either on the edge of your seat or catching your breath after gasping for air.
 Peter B 	  Very clever and fast-paced (almost too fast-paced) The Lego Batman is sure to delight adults and kids alike.
 Ryan L 	  Incredibly fast paced, incredibly funny.
 Taylor B 	  This is probably by far the best Lego movie ever made. Storyline was great, characters very funny and the entire time keep me interested. I had never laughed that good in a long time. Will Arnett is the best Batman!!
 Joo P 	  Funny, sarcastically effective and extremely well made, Lego Batman Movie is an impeccable animation full of great references and amazing action scenes. (4,5/5)
 Benjamin P 	  "...and I never skip leg day!"
 Vanessa D 	  Fun little movie that all DC fans will get a big kick out of.
 Joe E 	  Ridiculous, over the top, and not funny.
 Filipe C 	  A bit long and perhaps just too self-aware. All in all, though, it works and it's perhaps the best DC film in recent memory.
 Yo A 	  I loved this movie from start to finish.
 Carlos C 	  cool....una de las mejores peliculas de batman
 Poot T 	  It's a refreshing take on Batman. It's always the same story with him, and to see him finally lighten up a bit after so many years of acting edgy is satisfying. If you're a Batman fan, you'll love the countless references and easter eggs to older Batman shows, but the movie has enough humor in it that young children who don't know Batman very well can have a good laugh as well. Overall, fantastic movie for everyone to see.
 Jos B 	  enjoyable and quite funny but lacks the heart of the first Lego movie
 CJ L 	  Seen it...loved it...will add to my movie collection!
 James P 	  Funny in parts but mainly taxing
 Grinne C 	  The lego movie was a brilliant take on capitalism involving schumpeter creative destruction and how to properly behave (the need to obey rules and follow group think versus individuaism). The batman movie is about blowing things up. Kids loved it I fell asleep.
 Kenny Tanh L 	  Incredibly hilarious :DDD Batman is the best superhero by far
 Aaron T 	  This was worse than Batman and Robin. It's so much not like Batman that it seems that they only used the Batman name to make more money.
 Sarah B 	  Some really funny bits but overall not as good as the last one - mediocre storyline didn't help it along :(
 Felix P 	  not as good as Lego movie but still solid lot of adult humor
 Jimmy K 	  While a well-paced parody of the Batman mythos, boasting unique and fun takes on classic characters, Lego Batman is far from the definitive Batman film. However, its meta humor and genuinely impressive visual style definitely make it worth re-watching.
 Matthew M 	  Fun from start to finish.
 Meagan P 	  What a great story! I love Will Arnett as Batman. He is now my third favorite Batman next to Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck.
 Carter G 	  Although The Lego Batman movie is not nearly as hilarious as the first Lego movie, it manages to be a fun, and sometimes touching, adventure. It's packed to the rim with pop culture references and callbacks to past Batman films, and it's fun to see Batman poking fun at himself. Some jokes do fall flat, and Batman rapping is a painful endeavor,but for the most part both children and adults will be laughing along together while they watch Lego Batman.
 Hayden P 	  Smart and innovative in its humor, the Lego Batman Movie stands as a worthy success to its predecessor as well as a Batman film that works on its own.
 Paul M 	  I would never have expected The LEGO Movie to be a runaway hit when it came out in 2014. It was wildly creative even for someone who barely played with Legos as a kid. One of the best parts of that movie was its depiction of Batman, voiced by funnyman Will Arnett doing his best Christian Bale impression. Now Lego Batman has his own movie, and it not only lives up to the expectations of the first film, but also succeeds at being better than any of the DC Cinematic Universe movies so far. In a big sweeping opening scene, the Joker (Galifianakis) rounds up all of Gotham's finest villains and plants a bomb at the energy facility plant. Batman naturally swoops in and saves the day in pure Batman fashion. He heads back to Wayne Manor on Wayne Island where he lives with his butler, Alfred (Fiennes). We get a glimpse into his extremely lonely life despite living with 100% rage 24/7 365 days a year.The Joker and his crew return for their revenge at a gala for Commissioner Jim Gordon's (Elizondo) retirement. They stage a big takeover leaving new commissioner, Barbara Gordon (Dawson), and Batman scrambling to take control of the situation. In another surprise move, the Joker turns himself in and locks up the rest of his cronies. Batman's ego starts to get in the way when he gets the idea to send the Joker up into the Phantom Zone. Sounds great for the Caped Crusader but what he doesn't realize is that he's playing into the Joker's hand. Batman beams him up to the Zone where the Joker joins forces with some of cinema's greatest villains like King Kong, Godzilla, Sauron, Voldemort, and the Wicked Witch of the West. Back down in Gotham, Batman learns that he inadvertently agreed to take in an orphan boy. Surprise, it's Dick Grayson/Robin, voiced by the energetic Michael Cera. When the Joker and his swarm of villains strike down in Gotham, it becomes too great of a battle for Batman to face alone. He's a guy that typically likes to work alone but calls on Barbara, Robin, and even Alfred to save Gotham.Like the first film, it is high energy right from the very beginning. It starts with that big opening action sequence with the Joker and all of Gotham's finest ranging from Catwoman and The Riddler to King Tut, Egghead, and even The Condiment King. As someone that grew up watching the old 1966 Batman TV series with Adam West, I was giddy to see this appreciation for the old show and cartoony villains that came before. There's a joyful absurdity that comes into play when you realize the five person writing team has created a huge tribute to the entire Batman canon. There are images of various bat symbols, posters, comics, and multiple references to all of the previous movies. It's apparent that the creative team involved has a deep love of the superhero. Naturally, there are slight jabs at their rival, Marvel, along the way. One of Batman's passwords in the Batcave is "Iron Man sucks."As you can tell, there is plenty of silly humor to cater toward the kids in the audience who are still playing with Legos. Adults should not worry as there are just as many witty moments and adult jokes as well as messages to take back to your child. There's a new theme song, "Friends Are Family", highlighting the movie's importance on family for both Batman and Robin. Family can come in all shapes and sizes with the realization for both of them that it takes a village to make a change in this world. This concept really rang out true for me throughout the movie given the current political climate where we are seeing a very divided nation. The movie opens and closes with some lyrics from Michael Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" which felt very poignant. If I remember correctly, Batman even tries to take credit for the song thanks to his super huge ego.The LEGO Batman Movie doesn't technically belong in the DC Cinematic Universe with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice or Suicide Squad despite having the crossover characters. This take on the Caped Crusader is far superior to these recent iterations of Batman and Superman. I'll go so far as to say it's even better than the other recent Batman animated film The Killing Joke that was based on the graphic novel of the same name. It's a very self-aware movie, as it knows it's a Lego Batman movie and really plays into the fun of it. Unlike those other movies, this doesn't take itself too seriously. The premise is very simple and the film is essentially shaped around a bunch of action sequences, heavy use of Batman lore, and it's sense of humor. The writers know how to spoof the cocky attitude of Batman to make him funny while paying into the family themes. The voice talents of Will Arnett, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, Ralph Fiennes, and Zach Galifianakis are along for the kick-butt ride. I find it amusing that Fiennes is voicing Alfred instead of his legendary character Voldemort from the Harry Potter movies. Eddie Izzard plays him this time as he's on Team Joker.The animation isn't as detail oriented as the first film, which really adhered to everything looking and feeling like Lego pieces. Nor does this one have the "surprise" ending that the first film had. The first film felt so creative and inventive that perhaps this one can't have that same element of surprise that you just didn't expect going into the first film. The LEGO Batman Movie will surely leave kids and their Batman-obsessed parents having a great time. Did I mention there's a reference to Prince and his "Batdance?"Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Everything is awesome with this sequel.RATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS
 David O 	  Funny with a big heart and tons of references. Might wanna see this one several times!
 Jens S 	  Lots of movie references, guest appearances from (Warner Brothers) bad guys and inside jokes from decades of Batman films make this a really fun ride. Sometimes the jokes do not work, mostly because this Batman is trying really hard to be a jerk. Surprisingly, the film turns this around and really hits home in the final act, ends up really sweet and emotional. Some of the action is a bit hectic, but fans of the bat or the toy company will have a great time.
 William C 	  AMAZING! This film is laugh out loud and I personally think that it is better than the Lego movie!
 Facebook U 	  Thoroughly enjoyable, hella fun, and super emotional! Although the continuity logic of the plot are less intact compared to The LEGO Movie, story sucks you in to where to forget about it. Cast is great and the characters are colorful and fun! Just as good as the LEGO Movie!
 Tom H 	  So much fun, a great addition to the batman franchise (especially after last years travesties)
 Jacqueline B 	  Movie was pretty violent and too fast, hard to follow a plot. Characters kept repeating the same lines, which were not really positive, Batman kept asserting that he had no feelings and rather be alone than with people by his side, till pretty much the end. For a movie geared towards small kids, such repetitive message should have been a positive one.
 Graham J 	  This is a laugh out loud funny film from the first scene that trumps the last Batman film we saw, with great characters, a fantastic plot and moral, and most of all, amazing jokes and comedy! If you are a parent who's a fan of the dark vigilante , please go see this with your kids and family!
 john  	  this looks....interesting
 Anuj R 	  Warner Animation Group (WAG) excels with their second big screen film "The Lego Batman Movie", creating huge hopes for future installments in the "Legoverse".This movie comes from a place of fantastic spirit and the feeling starts from the opening production logos and Will Arnett's Batman narrating over it. To a fan, it feels like a beautiful homage to everything that The Batman has been in both comics and film and it's impossible to walk away from this film without a huge smile on your face. The cast is endearing, the animation is fast-paced and superb, the music is exciting, and the best part is that it feels like an adventure. What WAG is doing with their "Legoverse" is nothing new to them- the DCU has been churning out quality (with some big screen level) films for years now. However, there is a quality of it that brings to mind the "Disney Renaissance" era films being released in the 90's. And that is the unmistakable mesh of substance and style that allows children to be in awe of the film they are watching, being sucked wholeheartedly into that adventure. By pairing great humor, pop culture references, and subtle dark humor/adult-friendly jokes for the parents watching too, these movies have the potential to become even more entertaining when revisited years later, the same way "Toy Story" did for my generation. "The Lego Batman" is a must-see in theaters. Like the film's tagline states, "Back in Black" and better than ever.
 Darwin P 	  A lot of fun, specially Batman's voice. But with the Superhero theme it goes a bit crazy. The first Lego movie made more sense
 Sophia S 	  This movie was terrible. I can't see why anyone one would like such stupid comedy. It's was a waste of time and money.
 Conner B 	  Know I'm in the minority, but I thought this movie sucked. There was no story, just action action action. The animation was no where near as good as the Lego Movie. Just disappointing overall.
 Matthew U 	  this movie was pretty good I really enjoyed it I think it was just as funny as the first Lego Movie I would watch it again
 Theodore W 	  it was GAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAY
 Mat S 	  Watched in 3rd in D-Box seats at the 02 with my 7 year old. Amazing. We both loved it.
 Chris L 	  Loaded with little nuggets...need to see it again
 Bruno C 	  This is definitely the funniest Batman movie you will see and there is a great balance between paying homage to all the Batman movies that came before while also making fun of the DC Universe in the best Lego style. The only downside is that the cameos start really strong but they become forced and tired really fast. Prepare to have a great time nonetheless!
 Jason M 	  The LEGO Batman MovieInitial Reaction: It's 100% real - if LEGO were "Real".Main Characters Batman/Bruce Wayne: Yeah, that guy. He's voiced by Will Arnett. Robin/Dick Grayson: Yeah, that sidekick. He's voiced by Michael Cera. Joker: Yeah, that villain of Batman's. He's voiced by Zach Galifinakis.Plot Summary Things are going great for Batman. He just thwarted a massive scheme by Joker and his army of villains to blow up the city. But when the Joker gives up and has his fellow villains thrown in jail, there's no more need for a Batman.  And Bruce Wayne accidentally adopts a kid from the orphanage, Dick. Besides, Jokes is up to something while in prison, so Batman comes up with a plan to put him somewhere where he can't do any harm - a prison in another dimension. It's a rather complex plan - and he has to have Dick help him (as Robin). But if he pulls it off, he's sure that this will get rid of Joker for all time.SCORINGMain Characters I like these three because they're not simple cardboard cutouts. Each of them has an interesting personality and brings much needed flair to the story. SCORE: 10Supporting Cast The rest of the cast is good (I like Alfred as the guy who has to reign in Batman from his obsession with crime and the criminal element. And some of the villains in the film add some much needed flair to the mixture. SCORE: 9Plot I like the story a lot - even if it goes way over the top in the beginning and near the end. It really takes the time to let the story breathe and develop, making for a much more enjoyable trip. SCORE: 9Originality Okay, okay. I know that there have been far too many Batman films and that they should think about coming up with something more original rather than rehash the same thing over and over again. But this film really takes a hard look at the Caped Crusader, his allies and villains while poking fun at them. SCORE: 9Violence Factor A whole lot of LEGOs gets blown up during the making of this film. I'd hate to be the guy to find all those little LEGO pieces. SCORE: 9Other Moral Issues For a film filled with a lot of silly stuff, it has a great message about teamwork and letting others help out in a crisis. SCORE: 10Final Score (out of 60): 56 % Score: 93.33% So what's next on the LEGO list?
 Jamie C 	  Very funny family movie that will even please hardcore DC fans as let's face it this is just what DC needed after getting unfairly panned in every film they make lately, It's non stop laughs from the word go and hardly ever slows down, Full of some good animations and action scenes there's something for just about anyone, It even takes allot of shots at previous Batman films and even rips into superman allot too, But it's all in good fun, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version, It's better than The Lego Movie and it's hard to imagine anyone walking out of this film disappointed.
 Randy B 	  I loved and appreciated it for what it is. A campy, yet very witty and creative take on Batman, lego-formed. Much of the humor and banter, and speed of which it's said or in song, would be over the heads of many kids -- perfect for adults who appreciate animated movies. However, it's a perfect munchkin machine for collectibles, figurines, soundtrack, and video games.
 Kevin M. W 	  Made for the kids, so the action is fast paced. But there's literally tons of rib-tickling references to previous incarnations of the Bat that most of us have grown up with to make for a fun ride. Worthy.
 Anthony J 	  First half hilarious. Second half drags a little. The kids will love it.
 Frank O 	  I've never been so disappointed. I loved the first Lego movie, but this was trash. The entire audience (of a near full house) was totally silent after about minuet 5 or 10 (after the movie demolished all the good will that the first one had generated.)
 Brockney E 	  I love this character
 Ps J 	  an okay movie for people who love masturbate to self-aware jokes
 Jazzmin M 	  The Lego movie was amazing! The Lego Batman is not to so amazing. It's a redbox movie. Too much of the Lego batman being a Lego batman. It's not funny. I barely chuckled.
 Johnny N 	  Taking sarcasm to a Batman level.
 Ruthanne R 	  This was an absolute blast. Far cleverer than expected; Robin was not annoying; Barbara Gordon was amazing; and there are DALEKS.I'm gonna have to own this one on Blu-ray.
 Michael J 	  Not nearly as good as the first one. It's not even close.
 Ross V 	  Cute jokes and Batman references poorly tied together by something resembling a plot.
 Yogs B 	  If you're going to make a Batman movie funny, you have to do it right. With humor from old movies, (1966 Batman movie joke and bat shark repellent got me laughing.) Anyway, they did a good job with casting and everything in general. There was emotion and happy funny times, great movie
 Garrett C 	  really great movie and funny from start to end.
 Leo K 	  Funny, awesome, and doesn't give up batmans character even until the end (too much). The 3D graphics are intensely amazing! So intense, that it is overwhelming how much stuff is going on at times - TOO much stuff. But otherwise, everything is AWESOME!
 William C 	  When The Leggo Movie came out three years ago, the Batman character/avatar/whatever these things are called stole the show, so it was only natural that Warner Brothers studios went back to that well for a follow-up. It was certainly worth the trip.Teaming up with DC Entertainment, The Leggo Batman Movie is now out, and while it is not quite as over-the-top as Monty Python's work, its deadpan delivery is not far from that particular edge. The film skewers the Dark Knight legend, turning all the heavy material inherent of that franchise inside out with hilarious results.In fact, Batman might better be called "Basket Case" in this story. His childhood as an orphan has definitely led to some over-compensation, and he is a bundle of insecurities who would prove to be any Freudian's wet dream. Most men work out to acquire six-pack abs; he has a nine pack. His loner status, which he shares (or thinks he shares) with Superman, just makes him that much more mysterious and scary. And alone.And the less said about the homoerotic aspects of his "relationship" with the Joker, the better. On top of the gags and innuendo are references to earlier iterations of the "caped crusader." Of course, there is a bit rooted in the mid-sixties eye candy TV series, but this one even reaches back to the 1943 film serial renditions for its fun.This movie is an absolute howler, especially for parents and grandparents. Get thee to a Bat Cave!
 Carley E 	  Now I loved THE LEGO MOVIE and expected so much more from LEGO BATMAN. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The script was not near as smart as the first film about these colorful pieces of plastic and even grew repetitive and boring. Ah well. Wish I'd just waited to see it on my little screen.
 Robby K 	  Maybe I'm dead inside, or maybe we were so spoiled with "The Lego Movie" that any follow up would feel inferior. It's too enthused with itself to be consistent, ultimately making it the movie equivalent to that one guy who busts a gut and slaps his knee after every joke he tells. It has its moments, and if you temper your expectations, you'll leave the theatre happy.
 Mark O 	  Liked it as much as The Lego Movie!
 Connie G 	  Super cute family fun that will entertain adults as much kids! They nail the over the top cheesy-nature that is batman, while developing other, more multi-layered characters to support the film. Would definitely see it again!
 Dusty P 	  I could not have been more disappointed. I loved the Lego Movie and the character of Batman. But like Will Ferrell, a little bit of Lego Batman goes a long way and a whole movie is too much. There were moments, but those were in the trailers. Will Arnett is great but the film suffers from the villains. Batman has arguably one of the greatest group of villains than any other superhero (outside of Spider-Man) and they almost completely abandon them. The Joker is good and the references are funny at times, but all together fails to deliver.
 David D 	  Even better than The Lego Movie.
 Cristian P 	  The Batman Lego Movie is filled with masterfully crafted animation, comedy, and surprisingly emotional scenes that left me with the biggest smile coming out of the theater.
 Ronald H 	  Cute - boring - fell asleep in the middle (literally) -- mostly adults laughing during parts I was awake.
 Brittany h 	  Very cute family movie.
 SuperJisan Z 	  This was a bad movie and rather boring. The plot was confusing and overcomplicated. It might have been too over the top in its not being serious.
 Chad S 	  Best Batman movie (not really, but very good)!!!
 Brandon R 	  Great laughs for everyone.
 Ross W 	  Silly, fun, popcorn movie only slightly awkward because Batman talks in the same syntax as Trump
 David D 	  Great movie, great Batman movie and just great fun for all ages young and old.
 Tyson H 	  I could see this movie again and again. Wonderful characters and story development for a movie made out of a toy. 100% recommend seeing.
 Bryan C 	  It's not quite as good as the original "Lego Movie" in terms of appealing to a general audience, but if you enjoy superhero movies -- and particularly Batman movies -- this is a fantastic, silly spoof.Grade: A
 Daniel M 	  Interesting and fun Batman film.
 Cort J 	  Fun for kid and adults (hell likely more fun for adults)
 Johnie D 	  Good movie with a nice message, however it lacks the excitement of the first
 Jakeywakey 8 	  The humour is amazing the characters are amazing everything is good about this movie
 A.D. O 	  love love love robin so much. and batman kept reminding me of trump- ugh. good spinoff of the levi movie, great mockery of the super hero cliches.
 William F 	  It's cliche and over the top, but it's aware of itself in a way that doesn't hurt the film at all. If anything, this is a great comedy that also plays a great tribute to all of Batman's history, while managing to even deliver some emotional moments in this insane story. If you're a fan of Batman or Lego, you'll definitely love this film.
 Gareth D 	  What was once so original in The Lego Movie no longer is, it's still a decent film, frenetically paced and sometimes trying too hard to be irreverent, but fun and pretty witty. Worth a look.
 A G 	  Great humor for adults, but the fight scenes have to much going on, no good one on one battles. The slow scenes were actually the best. Action scenes hard to follow. Overall good movie.
 Spencer S 	  I don't know if I'm crazy or if the critics are. This movie was absolutely terrible. There were some redeeming qualities like funny movie references, occasional humorous jokes, and the first like 20 minutes. Other than that this movie is absolute garbage. I feel like that since this is a movie for five year olds and critics are forced to watch it, that 90 percent of them went to a bar and drank five gallons of beer before watching this movie. The other ten percent actually saw this movie for what it was. There is literally no other explanation to the highly rated reviews. There is so much crap and annoying, repetitive sounds thrown on the screen and it's just so sloppy and poorly done. This movie also has jokes that are repeated throughout the movie way to much which gets really irritating, and most of them don't even land for people over 6 years old. Trust me when I say this, this movie is a disaster and gave me a massive headache and if you have any type of common sense and your not a little baby then you will get one too.
 Ben H 	  Now Ben Affleck has really huge shoes to fill in, how he's gonna top Christopher Nolan's, or even this Lego Batman, that turn out to be quiet awesome...Q : How do you remake an almost masterpiece?A : You don't!
 Benjamin F 	  Hilarious. Especially if you're a Batman fan and get all the Batman movie references
 Angela B 	  I hate what they have done to the Batman character. He's too dark and obnoxious. Throw brought back the levity and fun of the character. My granddaughters and I laughed from beginning to end! We loved it!
 Tyler H 	  The movie has lots of laughs and lots of great batman references. A good film but not on the same level as "The Lego Movie". Batgirl definitely not my favorite either the story would of benefited better with a different story arch.
 Matthew B 	  You know DC f**ked up big time when a movie staring Lego figures started off a better cinematic universe than your live action movie.After the surprise that was "The Lego Movie", which was my favorite animated movie of 2014. So of course I was looking forward to this. When the team behind "Morel Orel" is directing your movie, it's going to be special. Now while I liked "The Lego Movie" a little more due to the writing and it's clever hidden message, but still."The Lego Batman Movie" is the best Batman movie since "The Dark Knight" and that's saying a lot. With it's bright warm colors, fast peace, and some many pop culture references for its humor. There was even a Pulp Fiction reference that I'm not sure many picked up on. It's a movie for both kids and adults. All of the Lego movies have two things in common which is heart and team work. It's really smart and goes as far from being just a kids movie.Heck, I almost teared up at point. That's right folks, I nearly cried during a movie staring Lego's. Wow.Will Arnett as Batman might be my third favorite portrayal of the Caped Crusader. Just the voice, emotion swings, and his cocky attitude is basically Batman in a nutshell. While a funnier version, but also an interesting and compelling one. By focusing on family and the loneliness of Batman. The movie itself makes fun of Batman's history with Adam West and Schumacher movies, but also being somewhat respectful as well.And who would've thought Zach Galifianakis was going to be a solid Joker. Galifianakis was having a blast with this, but also putting his own take on the character as well. The Jokers evil plans in the movie are so absurd and silly that somehow fits. It's perfect for the relationship between him and Batman. Making it a anti-romantic spoof.All of the other cast all did a fantastic job. Michael Cera was great as Robin and had excellent chemistry with Will Arnett. Rosario Dawson was pretty good as Batgirl / Barbara Gordon. And Ralph Fiennes as Alfred was spot on, but kind of a wasted opportunity that he didn't reprise his role of Voldemort by voicing him, because Voldemort is in the movie. Oh well.The animation is both really stunning and gorgeous. It's impressive that they once again made it look like it's stop motion animation with the power of CG. You can see the little details that you won't catch on your first watch. The finger prints that are clearly seen on the characters and the movement you would see in stop motion. I'm just be glad it's not the cheap looking direct-to-video animation that every movie starring Lego has been doing.My only issue with "Lego Batman Movie" is the pacing. As I said before, there are some many pop culture references and all of them are funny, but the film goes by so quick it's easy to miss them. It doesn't give you much time to breath. So while your laughing at the joke, it will then make two or three more jokes. I literally wanted to say to the movie "Please, slow down a bit". But I can see this easily been fixed by re-watching it, which may help.Overall rating: Everything Is Batman!
 Andrew S 	  Outstanding fun for the whole family
 Stephen B 	  Great kids movie! Highly recommend.
 Bobby N 	  Fast-paced and action packed for a cartoon. Few laughs. Catered more to older kids.
 John Mikkiah T 	  Best movie I've seen this year! The comedy was hilarious, the animation was awesome, the plot is excellent & the characters are so much fun! Another great edition to the Batman movie franchise & the Lego movie franchise!
 Darrell B 	  Honestly my expectations may have been too high because of comments from others who had seen the movie and being an avid Batman fan myself. While the animation was spectacular, the story left much to be desired. It wasn't really very funny, with the exception of the few nostalgia moments and had a weak script. I actually walked out before it ended due to boredom.
 Cristian B 	  Though not as fresh as THE LEGO MOVIE, the new movie still provides plenty of clever and satirical humor, in addition to the dazzling animation.
 Gabriel S 	  Superb and Hilarious movie/parody of Batman. A great new installment of the Lego movie universe!!! ??????
 E S 	  After expecting The Lego Movie to be a huge flop, but being proved extremely wrong, I was expecting great things from Lego Batman. I think the trailer gives a really good idea of how the movie is going to be and didn't lead me astray. It also didn't completely showcase all the good parts of the movie. As a big fan of Batman comics, movies, and DC as a whole, this movie completely catered to me while being appropriate for children. The film doesn't take itself too seriously while also giving Batman character development. I highly suggest this movie for anyone interested, especially lovers of the DC fandom.
 Calvin E 	  I liked it. I laughed out loud alot. Robin's portrayal was weird and took away from the movie a little. Overall, too long of a movie. You can only handle so much lego in your face action. Also, some of the animation was not very smooth. Batman himself is so funny though.
 Benjamin B 	  Not nearly as good as the Lego Movie. Fell asleep towards the end.
 AJ%20 R 	  I found The Lego Batman Movie enjoyable! It has a lot of great refrences from previous Batman movies, funny jokes, and lots of action. Defentily worth seeing.
 Martin B 	  This is the best Batman movie ever. Full stop (I'm now introducting this phrase into my daily conversation). I don't think this point is debatable, but just in case it is, I argue that this is, at the very least, the most fun.On eh this, as Poppy said on Seinfeld, there is eh, no debate eh!I do not remember enjoying myself this much watching a movie. It's been a long time since my eyes were this wide open and bedazzled. The kinetic energy was intoxicating. Joker was hilariously needy. Every other character was pitch perfect (Where do they get these wonderful actors?). The script was aces, crackerjack, self-aware, fourth-walling, sly and fun, filled with references to, well, everything in the known universe, but especially the previous Batman movies (and Suicide Squad! Ha! What a dig!) and loads of 80s pop culture on a higher degree than the greatest current show in the universe: Stranger Things.I sensed that the movie had a very Robot Chicken vibe. Indeed, I later discovered, the film's director is a veteran of the series! Nailed it! I also really like its teamwork message for kids, and it's non-heavyhandedness in dealing with loss. They kept it real from that standpoint.I also really, really, really love the script. I have to read it. It's not available. Somebody find it for me.While you're doing that, I'll go work on my 9-pack.
 Kristian T 	  Not great. Typical sequel fashion applies to this movie. Very cheesy jokes that don't mesh well with the rest of the movie and forced humor, really make this movie just feel like it's trying to hard to be the first lego movie. Graphics are still great, story line was pretty good for a lego sequel, just was not what I expected or wanted, but still alright.
 Pete P 	  Em....this movie was not a good one. First Lego film was well written and contained witty, intelligent, and agreeable social commentary. This film fails as a kid's story and the sometimes-funny adult focused comedic elements are not well integrated into the story. My nephew and niece didn't like it and I found myself looking at my watch about a half hour in. I really felt like I paid good money for an advertisement. And so ends my Lego movie enthusiasm.
 Daniel M 	  Lego Batman is a brilliant, self aware, over the top comedy.
 Peter M 	  A friend of mine recently asked why this movie got better reviews than the last few DC movies and my response was "Perhaps because it doesn't take itself so damned seriously?". Turns out I was absolutely right!! If you're tired of "grittiness" in your superhero movies, then I highly recommend this one!
 Dave R 	  I liked the original Lego Movie, but I didn't love it. The same now goes for Lego Batman movie, as i give it a like not a love. The first half of the movie is way better then the second. The clever lines and sights come fast and furious, so don't blink at all. However, the second half tries to do much the same and there lies the problem. The second half of the movie doesn't bring anything new to the table really. The overall story is clever enough, but the rough voice talking, loner, self absorbed Batman just simply grows tiresome, and you know exactly where the movie is headed by the end. If you liked the first Lego movie and thought that the Batman character was fun in that one, you will likely enjoy it, if not, stay away from this one.
 Mahdi H 	  There are two favorites Batman versions, this one and the ordinary one(like in justice league dark) whom became the one in (the dark knight returns) maybe, Batfleck will be the second one. Anw this movie is a blockbuster~
 Louise D 	  Preferred the first half, before Batman starts learning his life lessons. Also lacking the unexpected charm and originality of The Lego Movie. The jokes and animation are top drawer though, much better than they needed to be for a kids' movie.
 James W 	  It's a kids film, there's a message and it's really hammered home but it's a kid film, I'm not expecting some complex twisting plot. It's fun and that is what is important. Okay what was up with calling the batman villains C listers, they're the best!Fun gags, bright colours, lots of action, fun cameos, and plenty of previous batman incarnation references make this a fun films for kids and an amusing watch for batman fans.
 Chris M 	  I'll Turn Two-Face Into Black And Blue Face! -BATMAN
 Official C 	  The amount of jokes and quips in this movie is countless, but that is also where the movie falters, as it does get overly exhausting at times. That being said, "The Lego Batman Movie" has the same tone as the first movie and is consistently engaging.
 Amanda W 	  The was like a PG-rated episode of Bojack Horseman. It was probably way more fun for adults than kids!
 luc h 	  Batman's spin off episode to the Lego Movie in my opinion worked beautifully, it was funny, engaging and it had easter eggs for DC as well as Marvel fans, a great film for the kids but with hidden jokes slipped in for the older ones in the cinema.
 Edward C 	  Not as good as you'd expect. Longer than you can endure.
 Edmarc H 	  Fun movie. Simple plot. Batman v one dimensional.
 Loni G 	  This movie was awesome! Giggled the whole time.Pew Pew Pew ??
 Aiden M 	  So good had humor and heart!!!
 Jacob B 	  #Zach galifinakis is #Joker was ok. # #MichaelCera #Robbin was just right...lol...Must reach to catch all the jokes. Over all good job, and great references. Excellent cast, and #TwoFace is the same acer from #BatmanReturns.
 Vuong B 	  absolutely hilarious
 Colin K 	  Hilarious!!! The first 15 minutes is the best thing DC has ever done with movies!
 Thomas H 	  Jurassic Park and Lord of the Rings are two of my favourite franchises, Batman usually has some of the best movies/cartoons, The LEGO Movie was really really funny and had genuine nostalgia/heart put into it, I'm a big fan of most of the cast, so by all logic this should be a damn good movie for me.But it isn't, in fact it's the only blockbuster movie I've actually fell asleep while watching at the cinema. I don't understand the critic's praise, it's very over-rated.The problems: The Joker is terrible, the voice really doesn't fit and it has to be the lamest incarnation to date. I'm not expecting Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson but this Joker is Suicide Squad levels of making you curl up in embarrassment at the film. They have so many Batman villains in the film...that show up for 5 minutes, and then add even MORE villains who aren't even related to Batman, which sucks! None of these villains get any development except for the Joker, and it's just so boring and nonsensical to have Voldemort and Sauron in the movie because they couldn't put a good BATMAN story together. Batman also raps too much (what is this, the 90s? who still finds that funny?) and the 'meta' humour comes across like a 9 year old's Twitter memes. The whole thing just becomes so exhausting cus they try to throw so much at you in terms of villains and action to distract you from the fact that there's not much to see.You could remake the whole film with any Lego characters and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. And the 'emotional' plot where Batman is lonely etc etc? It's basically just child neglect the movie and then some stuff shoehorned in at the very end which feels so tacked on it's like they did it in the last 10 minutes of editing. I'll give it some credit for having a good joke once in a while, but it in no way makes you laugh often unless you find butts and white guys rapping badly funny. The referential humour gets pretty tiring after the first half an hour, especially with the unnecessary overload of other universes. Should you go and see it? Nahnahnahnahnahnahnahnah....
 Fernando C 	  batman is my favorite superhero! and I have to say this movie was a totally blast experience for me, loved it, the references, the jokes, the characters, damn this movie is awesome, forget batman v superman, this is the batman movie weve been waiting for.
 Jason A 	  The story, as expected, is what rises this film to one of the better films of the year.
 Hunter B 	  Laugh out loud funny
 Trent G 	  Loved the opening, until the jerk kid behind me kept interrupting the rest of the movie, so I wish I could have enjoyed it more. Some great in jokes & manic humour.
 Happy The Fox  	  Probably my favourite movie so far, I was never a huge fan of batman but after this I was obsessed! Enjoyable for everyone
 Michael W 	  I had VERY HIGH hopes/standards for this film and while it was VERY GOOD it was not GREAT. Perhaps a re-watch at a future date will allow me to uncover some aspects that were missed on the first viewing-2/20/17
 Rosie C 	  This might be the single best DC hero movie every made.
 JuanKa P 	  Lego Batman deber salvar a Ciudad Gtica una vez ms, pero solo lograr hacerlo con la ayuda de sus amigos. Esta vez el Guasn se ha propuesto traer a las peores enemigos de la humanidad y solamente, cuando Batman deje de lado sus inseguridades, vanidades y temores, Batman aprender a pedir ayuda a sus amigos y superar al mal. Muy divertida!
 Peter W 	  fun. not gonna be talking about it in the office, but a nice way to burn a couple hours on the weekend with the kids.
 Cliff J 	  The beautiful thing about a Batman parody via Legos? No back story or realism are required. It would seem that every joke and reference are teed up for you (not to mention a seemingly unlimited special effects budget). But this story actually would have benefited by being a bit more constrained. They did not need every WB villain of all time. They did not need to try SOOO hard. They did not need to undercut the suspense by making it clear Batman always wins. A simple Batman story would have worked. Anyway, I still laughed, but when the funniest lines are in the trailers...
 Eric P 	  This may be no Citizen Kane but it was pretty good.
 Mathew H 	  Very funny and entertaining
 Rebecca F 	  I absolutely love this movie. All of my friends loved it too. I actually cried laughing at one point. It also really touched me emotionally, and I think they got most of the characterization pretty much perfect. The whole theater really enjoyed it!
 Jacob S 	  I really enjoyed the LEGO Movie, but I didn't see LEGO Batman as such an important role so I feel him receiving his own film is ultimately unnecessary.
 Nico A 	  this movie was one of the best animated movies I ever seen. but theres a big problem.The balance of the movie between the action and the jokes is not well balanced the action is much more put and only see 5 or 3 jokes in the movie. But the truth if I love this movie
 Kaelyn S 	  Loved it. Humor was great for all ages but I'm confused as to why it had the same plot as Holy Musical B@man.
 Joshua M 	  Come in for the fun, and stay for it, too! Ignore Zack Galifinakis' Joker and the plot (because it's kinda very lame and dumb), and you'll have a good time. Some of the best humor of the flick came from the references to Batman's lore, both past and present, especially those references and sight gags related to the character's cinematic history. I have not laughed so hard at a comedy in such a long time. The other voices actors in the cast acquit themselves nicely, but I favored Michael Cera as Robin/Dick Grayson the most.
 Sara B 	  The husband and the guy friends liked it a lot. Me, meh it was okay.
 Don W 	  Kids are going to love this. Adults are going to love this. Just like the first movie, there's a perfect blend of Shiny-Happy-Colours!! and subtle references to Batman lore that will leave you in stitches. Seriously - those who've followed the character in comics, or on TV going back to Adam West are going to love this.
 harmy h 	  pretty cute kids movie
 Frazer M 	  batman quote:I am vengeance I am darkness I am batmanjoker quote:you ever with the devil in the pail moon lightjoker quote:oh I'm not dunna kill ya I'm just gonna hurt you really really badbatman quote:Rachel rachel!!!!!!!!
 Michael B 	  LOVED it, at this point Im ready for Lego to just take over the Batman Franchise because they KILL IT!!! Best Batman I've seen in years. This is a film that will entertain all from 4 up! Just perfection
 Jonathan D 	  I liked this "Sequel" to the LEGO movie, but I didn't like it nearly as much as the LEGO Movie. It starts off very funny, but loses some humor in the middle. Robin is probably the funniest part of this movie. Still fun, just not as good as the LEGO Movie.
 Jamie K 	  An energetic and funny take on a classic character.
 Joshua T 	  I loved this movie this movie is for all ages and it very funny
 clara c 	  best goddamn movie i've seen in my life
 Karla D 	  Too dumb for kids and adults. Nothing to do with its predecessor The Lego Movie. Its pretty much de same animation, but without the heart, the inocent comedy, the likeable characters and inmature.
 Jeff A 	  A hilarious, tremendous love letter to Batman.
 Dorian G 	  Very fun, for adults and kids alike. Expands on the Lego Movie universe, mostly with Batman, obviously, but throws in a slew of other DC Comics heroes for good measure. Plenty of witty humour, and good quick jokes for the kids. Good use of music, and fun "master builder" segments. Overall, not quite as good as the first Lego Movie, but definitely still worth watching. Watched at Westhills Theatre with Priscilla, Tim, Amelia, Ethan, Chase, Natalie, Adrienne, Katherine, Makayla, Marlowe, and Sam, February 18, 2017.
 Carlos G 	  Headache. Gave me a headache. Very few laughs on audience.
 Zack V 	  I LOVE IT!!!! Make a sequel, And the actors Are terrific, And Of course, Batman Hits The theatre With A lot Of people. THE TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT ALL THE TIME!!!!
 Sam W 	  An entertaining, fun and enjoyable onslaught of action, comedy, colour and music. Good story, great acting and superb range of characters from a variety of sources, but it does cram a lot in and it does lay the moral of the story on very thick. Spectacular to watch with a great selection of humour throughout.
 John D 	  That's how you do it! take note Snyder!! best batman film since the dark knight
 James C 	  funny batman lines are frequently delivered and maybe abit to much, despite featuring some good moments, the general storyline was disapointing
 Smashproplaya ! 	  The original is better, but this is still pretty good.
 Michael R 	  As much as I loved the first movie, this one disappointed a bit. Yes it was funny, but it felt dragged out, and used other elements from different superheroes to beef up the story line, which distracted it from Batman, the main character. Think its one of those that I may need to see again, and hope I will like it more a second time.
 CA Cougar M 	  The first GREAT movie of 2017!
 Cort H 	  Really funny! Pretty sure the adults liked it even more than the kids!!
 Richard Y 	  Story and premise miles better than the real life Batman movies. Filled with satire, funny in places, moving in others, quite original.
 Aaron E 	  Everything is awesome... again. Sharp, hilarious, brilliant animation, touching story, and rewarding for all, from the youngest viewer to the deep cuts DC fan.
 Yovani V 	  This movie understands its characters and source material, like nothing since the dark night, and truly delivers a funny yet remarkable production with an interesting protagonist.
 Denislav R 	  Why can't all DC movies be like this one.... Very funny, beautifully animated, random at times, very funny, funny. In top 3 commercials I've seen and my third favorite Batman movie. Batman himself was a very refreshing version of the character. He did still come with his mommy and daddy issues, but they were kept to a tolerable amount. They are in fact the only reason this movie isn't 5 stars. Most of all I love how the movie didn't take itself seriously. I want to see more Lego movies. I already bought like a hundred of Legos anyways....
 Camille L 	  Pendant 20 minutes, The Lego Batman Movie est plutt drle, intelligent et plutt intressant dans sa (d)construction du mythe de Batman. Malheureusement, le film de Chris McKay en dure 1h44. Rythmer un film  raison de cinq gags rfrentiels par minute est trs compliqu et force est de constater que Lego Batman se plante dans les grandes largeurs. Le film passe alors d'intelligent  pnible, un peu  l'image de Will Arnett en Batman, d'nergique  excit et de potache  cynique. L'intrigue principale est carrment stupide, les enjeux dramatiques peu engageants et le casting vocal moyen. Reste alors l'originalit de l'entreprise, difficile  contredire. Chris McKay est ralisateur pour Robot Chicken. Peut-tre aurait-il mieux fallu prendre les scnaristes pour russir le film.
 Brett B 	  Everything is still awesome.
 Mohammed A 	  could not stop laughing , great movie
 Gary B 	  Really funny film from start to finish. The humour is a great mix throughout. The references to older Batman's and other franchises are brilliant.
 Alejandro C 	  Lo mejor son los personajes y alguno de los chistes. Ahora, reconozco que se me hizo un poco larga. Quizs es porque la vi con bastante sueo.
 Nicolas B 	  So funny ! I never thought i'd laugh so much on a Batman movie !!
 Brian N 	  It was a fun movie that was quite amusing. Lots of Batman jokes. It was a good story. Definitely worth a watch for everyone.
 Nick E 	  Relentlessly funny and touching at times; The Lego Batman Movie caters to both die-hard fans and newcomers alike.
 Tiffany K 	  one of the very few movies I walked out on half way through. it's truly unwatchable which is a shame bc I liked the original.
 Jc F 	  Love love loved. If it wasn't for the over the head message beating I would have given it s full five, but I'm glad that part was in there for families.
 Jerome K 	  Even though I consider The Lego Movie from 2014 to be slightly better (it was a little more focused, meta, and heartfelt), I still had a blast watching this spinoff. You don't have to know much about Batman to enjoy the high energy action and marvelous animation, and there is a plethora of Easter eggs for fans. Even though it's a parody, it's still a love letter to Batman at the same time. I especially loved all the nods to every incarnation of Batman, whether it's the comics, movies, or TV shows. The idea of Batman struggling with working alone or with family/friends has been done many times before. The downside of being a fan is that it does get tiring in this film considering how it's one of the main plot points and constantly brought up. Nonetheless, the story will hold your attention from start to finish, and it's a great time for kids and adults.
 David D 	  Loved this movie! Great humor throughout. A joy for kids and adults to watch. Animation is fantastic, Arnett does a great job voicing Batman. Perfect combination of action, humor, and good heartfelt messages. I honestly can't think of a reason not to give it 5 stars but I'll keep it at 4 1/2 in case I'm forgetting something :).
 STCENTERPRISE . 	  The Lego Batman Movie (2017)The movie was great at the beginning. The film starts of with an adrenaline rush of laughter but half way through the film and it was just went too much. The film went all big showed all it's cards at the beginning so much so that there were no further surprises after the first 30 minutes of the film so anything else that comes after the first thirty minutes is no longer a surprise.I though that this film did a great job understanding the genre of Batman but after a particular point it just came too much. It went too quick to go too far as far as the jokes. The film did not know where to stop. The end resolution was ridiculous. I enjoyed & liked the fact that this film at least understood the Batman genre. It was obvious that a lot of research and fandom went into this film as far as the story, the characters, incorporated obscure villains, the obscure details from the previous reiterations, even up to the film score that incorporated elements and ques from the previous reiterations of Batman. Especially in the track "Battle Royale" done by Lorne Balfe. Great film score as well as the other songs in this film soundtrack. I enjoyed the fact that this film was able to incorporate obscure villains and references of the previous Batman reiterations.The depiction of the action was extraordinary. I was disappointed by how little there was so little of the Justice League. I did want to see more than just a party scene. I wanted to see more interaction.This one did more psychoanalyze Batman/Bruce Wayne family issues. This film went from high energy to a sudden dip because went so high. It was like the film started off with someone drinking a energy drink like Hammy in the Over the Hedge film but then eventually after you have a party the audience is like okay we have heard that. We went so high that there was no where else to go but down. This film had far too many jokes and gets exhausting and too much. I think it would have been better if there were a little more serious issues intermixed to the laughter to keep it focused.I wish that this film worked more on the other villains besides the Joker. This film had so many villains but not enough to get you invested in the other villains besides The Joker. This film did draw on too long on too much drawings. There may have been just a touch too much talking roles by Batman. I wish we saw a little more of Bruce Wayne and less of Batman. This film had plenty of Batman and not enough focus on the villains. This film understands his distance he tries to get from the rest of society so he does not emotionally invested in other people. Those who suffer from ADHD, are not big fans of Lego or Batman may not be a fan of this film because they will not understand the references.
 Eric M 	  It was just okay. They showed most of the funny parts in all the TV movie previews. The whole "being alone act" of Lego batman just became old after a while.
 Paula O 	  Shark repellent, Voldemort, 60's Batman, constant sarcasm and so many jokes I couldn't keep up with them all - what's not to love!
 Bo K 	  Overall The Lego Batman Movie was fairly good. Was honestly a little disappointed in it considering The Lego Movie was fantastic. The Lego Batman Movie had some very funny scenes and some great Easter eggs for the fans but also had some stretches that were pretty boring. Animation was great, story was good, and the voice acting overall was okay. A big step down from The Lego Movie but it was overall a fun and enjoyable watch.
 Jeffrey O 	  It was okay. Not as good as the first Lego movie.
 steve h 	  Either the writing was poor or the delivery was off. Not even close as funny or fun as The Lego Movie. I will say it finished strong but it took 80 minutes to get there. One of the funniest parts was in the opening credits which is sad.
 Laura D 	  Entertaining. Did not carry the same punch as The Lego Movie.
 Daniel C 	  Even more than its predecessor, The LEGO Batman movie balances wit, humor, thematic import, economic storytelling, and dazzling aesthetics to make for a great film.
 Matt S 	  This was an absolute must see for kids and adults. This movie was hilarious.
 Dylan C 	  A funny, and well made Lego film. It did a great job making fun of previous Batman incarnations. Will Arnett voices an excellent Batman. The movie presented the Batman-Joker relationship expertly.
 Yash B 	  This movie is nonstop fun from beginning to end. Batman was one of the best parts of "The Lego Movie" and giving the character his own movie was a great decision. I found myself laughing hard and frequently throughout this movie. It's a movie that people of all ages can enjoy together. It also has some nice heartfelt moments which are expected in an animated movie. I found many of the action scenes to be engaging and all of the jokes were clever and funny. I do think that the story does meander for some parts of the movie and slows down in places. However, when this movie is going, it moves insanely fast and keeping up with it is a blast.
 Nolly S 	  if I could give this a - I would this whole movie is based on the dull witted batman lonely hero. I slept through this move. trust me, it is so overrated
 Terry M 	  Loved the movie. Well written, funny, well acted. A lot of the billionaire selfishness at the beginning reminded me of our #SCROTUS although I don't think he will have a reckoning like Batman did in the movie. I was annoyed as the credits rolled to learn that the movie was Executive Produced and therefore partially financed by Steven Mnuchin. Upon reading his long list of movies he has Executive Produced starting with American Sniper it is hard to #GrabYourWallet and avoid paying into something that has profited from throwing people out of their homes when they are so widely invested. Good Movie made me feel bad now. #NotMyPresident
 Drew M 	  4 Stars. It's incredibly well made and Will Arnett is the perfect choice to voice Batman. The humor of the film didn't do much for me unfortunately though. Maybe I'm a little dead inside? Still incredibly well done film and is very much worth the watch.
 Vicki L 	  So very funny. Fantastic c fun
 Alika T 	  It was cute.. Wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be. But it was entertaining.
 Brian M 	  Kids liked it but the story stunk to keep this 40 year olds attention. Arnett was funny and great references to previous batmen.
 Jared B 	  Fast, fun, and silly, The LEGO Batman movie celebrates and makes fun of him at the same time.
 Glenn G 	  A CHIP OFF THE OLD BRICK - My Review of THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE (3 Stars)The script for THE LEGO MOVIE contained more wit per moment than all of the episodes of 30 ROCK and THE UNBREAKABLE KIMMY SCHMIDT combined, but the busy backgrounds made my eyeballs bleed into my popcorn. Alas, we'll always have "Everything Is Awesome" from it, but needless to say, I had no desire to have another seizure-inducing experience when I heard of this spinoff, but I was a sucker for Will Arnett's performance as Batman, especially his hilarious reading of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS-style line, "I will text you!" I'm glad I went to see THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE, because the filmmakers learned a thing or two from the first to produce a hilarious, ridiculously self-conscious and overly referential piece of comedy that streamlined its set design so that its main characters would pop out more. It's not quite as funny, but it's much more watchable. It's a trade-off I can live with, especially with Arnett front and center. Starting with an opening voiceover that tries to top the credits from DEADPOOL (let's face it, DEADPOOL will always win this battle), THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE centers on our rich superhero narcissist as he tries to save Gotham City from the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) and virtually every other criminal, while trying to raise his adopted Boy Wonder, Robin (Michael Cera). If only he could stop thinking about himself long enough to save the world from nuclear annihilation. The jokes come thick and fast, with director Chris McKay and pretty much every studio screenwriter in Hollywood hitting their marks roughly 70% of the time. That's not a bad average when you get a joke thrown at you literally every 3 seconds. Although filled with giant action set pieces and explosions, some of my favorite bits involved extremely simple setups. I savored watching Batman stand in front of a microwave waiting for his meal to heat up as we wait almost the entire 2 minutes with him. It's random and dopey, but a well-timed laugh nonetheless. Some of the voiceover actors do better than others with Arnett taking the prize with his low monotone growl lending importance to everything regardless of its value. Ralph Fiennes mades a delightfully droll Alfred, clearly expanding on comic chops he showed off so well in THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL and HAIL, CAESAR! I enjoyed Mariah Carey's work as the Mayor as she brings a little Debi Mazar flavor to the proceedings. I wish Jenny Slate as Harley Quinn (and Galifianakis) had brought more to the table, but it's tough to outdo Margot Robbie from the otherwise execrable SUICIDE SQUAD. Ultimately, THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE will make you laugh, but it's so much a part of our disposable pop culture, that I forgot almost all of it the minute I left the theater. I think of a stop motion classic like TEAM AMERICA and can still recall the hilarious sex scene, the over-the-top screaming by Kim Jong Il and the song "America F*ck Yeah". Think of THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE as a good time killer and nothing more.
 ryan g 	  its ok it had it funny monetes its ok like
 Robert B 	  Once again, the animation is superb. A few good laughs and DC jokes. Just like the lego movie, i felt at times they pushed too much but overall a great movie
 Michelle C 	  It was a bit too long, it tried a bit too hard to be funny, and it wasn't all that interesting animation wise. Every now and again there would be a witty one-liner to enjoy, which gave it the extra half star.
 Alan J 	  It's a continuation from the witty one-liner Batman in The Lego Movie, but with a complimentary supporting cast of Robin, Alfred and Co. What this film does best is recognise exactly what it is by identifying the flawsn of (both positive and negative) the title character and letting the plot drive the humour around these well made points in Batman history. A very well crafted addition to the Lego franchise.
 Chris C 	  Not quite everything is awesome, but very fun and entertaining. A notch below the Lego Movie in terms of humor and quality.
 Barry Y 	  Your kids will probably enjoy this movie. As a Batman fan, I wasn't fully satisfied.
 Peter W 	  The kids loved it, which means Daddy loved it! "DC, The House that Batman built!"
 Alisa W 	  I watched it and it was funny, scary, sad, and happy, and it's also very educational
 Noah M 	  It reflects the spirit of this time, everything has to be fast and sarcastic..Some cameo's are funny, and I admire the visual effects.But it is not that good
 Mark P 	  a lot of fun for kids but not my cup of tea. Think I'll stick to watching Keaton or Bale as Batman
 Shane P 	  It was enjoyable, but not as much as the first Lego movie.
 Jeff P 	  This was damn near perfect. I laughed non-stop. Will Arnett gives us exactly what anyone who enjoyed the Lego Movie will be anticipating with a follow-up. I will watch this again for sure.
 Brevon T 	  Batman is not suppose to be a family friendly and camp character.
 Andy C 	  Niech si? ucz? od twrcw tego filmu!!!! Najlepszy!!!!!
 arif s 	  If I have to count for the best batman movie, it will easily in the top 3!! IT IS DAMN GOOD!! a really funny story with packed humours, hilarious emotions and a great assembles of superheroes and villains!! specially the climax of the film makes it incredibly hilarious!! this is really a great tale of batman and his backstory.... it really shows DC what they have been doing wrong in DCEU!! they must learn from it.. even with LEGO, it is indeed a true complete batman movie!! THIS IS ANOTHER MASSIVE SUPERHERO CLASSIC!! Must Watch!!!
 Jacob M 	  Funny and beautifully-animated, this is a Batman film that holds up much better than some more-serious adaptations of the past.
 Dan S 	  Horrible. Save yourself the time.
 Tami S 	  Action-packed and riddled with humor, this movie is visually appealing and the story is engaging.
 Mloy X 	  [from trailerBarbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson): Why did you build this thing with only one seat?Batman (Will Arnett): Because last I checked I only had one butt.The film was pretty entertaining, lots of cute little quotable quips and non-stop, good action sequences from start to finish (although for some reason it felt like it was longer than the hour and a half running time). As with a lot of animated films, a majority of the jokes were geared towards the adults in the audience but I heard a lot of the kids (especially the one sitting next to me-- my nephew) laughing out loud throughout the entire film. The characters weren't as endearing as the cast from the original Lego Movie (a.k.a. Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Wyldstyle/Lucy (voiced by Elizabeth Banks)) but this was still a pretty fun family film. Overall, it was a pretty good and enjoyable movie to watch.
 Meridith N 	  Although there were several funny moments Lego Batman could not come close to the first Lego movie.
 plan v 	  great sense of humor
 Dylan S 	  Accidentally saw it 5 times
 Michael S 	  More comedy than anything else, "Lego Batman" tells the tale of how Batman must learn to go from extreme narcissist to... well, something slightly less extreme at least. A hilarious sendup of super hero cliches as well as a decent super hero movie in its own right, the movie goes for lots of laughs both cheap and thoughtful, but loses steam in the second half. Still, the sight of some classic WB villains battling it out in this Lego version of Gotham is really enjoyable.
 Courtney P 	  Too long. Some cute moments but weak story and no heart.
 Ted A 	  Great movie! Loved alfred.Didn't like the Joker-Batman "i hate you" relationship though.
 John G 	  Es una pelcula muy divertida tanto para nios como adultos. Creo que gran parte de este xito es del excelente doblaje al espaol latino.
 J S 	  Cheesy but funny and entertaining
 joseph h 	  A hilarious Batman movie that proves that Will Arnett is one of the better Batmans
 Ellen M 	  Very funny, very clever, surprisingly moving at moments, and brilliantly animated, I recommend this to any Batman fan who can laugh at themselves and the caped crusador between times taking both very (if not too) seriously.
 Stuart M 	  It's okay, I guess. I wonder what all the critics praising the film's irreverent take on Batman would have to say if they watched the Brave and the Bold. The basic themes of loss and emotional distance are well handled. Batman's as immature a jerk as you would expect. I was really impressed with Robin, whose vulnerable enthusiasm quickly made him my favorite character. And I don't say that every day! But as I watched the film I just had to wonder why Lego needed to be involved at all? I mean, they did bring in villains like Sauron and Voldemort, but it still seemed like they could have just made a regular Batman cartoon and had it work just as well. I found it distracting whenever things shifted into Lego mode.
 David L 	  The Lego Batman Movie again has overwhelming action at times, it is definitely crowded with too many characters and some plot points are typical and obvious, but this is mostly a very good, satisfying spin-off with excellent voice acting, very good humor with many very funny lines and a great use of its characters with Batman in particular being not only funny, but also surprisingly well developed. It is ultimately an improvement over its predecessor because it is funnier and it has a much bigger heart.
 Dakota S 	  Eye, ear, and brain candy for all ages.
 Keith W 	  Took the kids to see this yesterday, Kids really enjoyed it, I loved all the Batman Movie References
 Alan W 	  Juvenile humour sits side by side with clever meta-postmodern in-jokes for the more film savvy amongst the audience - Lego's spoof of the Batman movies is messy and chaotic Fun for ages 3 to 103. Will Arnett's Batman and Zach Galifianakis's Joker are as good as any of their predecessors, with additional comedic timing, but with every cultural and cinematic icons from the superheroes in the Justice League to 'villains' such as King Kong, Sauron, the Daleks British Robots and Voldemort appearing also, the voice talent behind them is like a bizarro recasting come true via Lego logic/magic. The themes of family and loss are organically derived from the Batman series but the treatment here is a little sentimental and familiar and the new song proves that not everything is as awesome as Everything is Awesome. (Though their use of the 1966 Batman theme is very funny and certainly more memorable.) Not as surprisingly good as the Lego Movie, there is enough zaniness and JPM (jokes per minutes) here to keep the film chuckling along and is a massive improvement from the last Batman movie.
 Johnathon W 	  Hilarious superhero satire that not only continues Lego's streak of epic films but actually the best DC in years. The vocal cast is excellent across the board, with Will Arnett continuing his epic work from "The Lego Movie" as Batman, in arguably the best vocal performance of the character since Kevin Conroy. The rest of the cast is equally excellent, especially Zach Galifianakas as the Joker, who wrings out a bit of sympathy for the crazed clown. Behind the camera, director Chris McCay has fantastic fun playing with both the DC & Lego universes. While the tone of the film is satirical in nature, he manages to be more faithful than the recent DC films to the source material, with numerous cameos (DC fans will smile at all the appearances) & even getting to the heart of the characters, whether it's why Batman is a loner to his relationship with the Joker. The pop culture references & soundtrack is a bit over done and one wishes the film spent a bit more time exploring the characters, granted because they do such a great job of it. Nevertheless, this is another example of why Lego is one of the best new franchises in movies and if Warner Brothers wanted to get the DC movies back on track, they would make them all Lego.
 Russell H 	  One of the best superhero movies in quite some time.
 Bill W 	  Laugh out loud funny with heart. Stunning visually. Nice to see Batman given the lego treatment. Very smart dialogue and surprisingly touching coming of age story.
 Robert B 	  having had so much fun with the humor in The Lego Movie, I was really let down with Batman Lego. . . it was way more serious than I expected it to be and the humor was very little.the story was fine and the many different batman clichs were entertaining, but overall, could have been better.
 Andrew H 	  Great movie that was I really enjoyed it!
 Pete A 	  Zany and fun to watch. Arguably better than one or two of the live-action versions, which I never expected to say.
 Naufal H 	  It's full of satirical comedy making fun of stereotypical superhero cliches. Satire requires full knowledge of context--and you will be laughing nonstop if you DO understand the context.
 Andrew O 	  After the astonishing Lego Movie, that films best character gets his own film and it's awesome. Batman must not only deal with the criminals of Gotham City, but also the responsibility of raising a boy he adopted and learn to work with others.First and foremost the films animation is great. Just as with the Lego Movie the screen is bursting with imagination and vivid colours. It looks brilliant and the visuals alone will keep you entertained.But the script as well is a humdinger. The jokes come thick and fast and while a few miss most hit the target. The best gags are at the main characters expense, one stand out scene rips all the previous Batman films. There's even a few digs at another major comic book character that are laugh out loud.The cast are all good value. Will Arnet as Batman is great and there's good support too from Rosario Dawson, Zach Galifanakis and especially from Ralph Fiennes.While not as original as the Lego Movie this is great fun and will keep the little ones entertained while making the grown ups giggle.
 Darren B 	  Sadly it wasn't all that great. As another reviewer had noted, it was a huge missed opportunity to really have with this. The other thing is it lacked any real emotion. Only worth checking out if a fan of the original Lego movie.
 Will S 	  Fantastic. As a Batman fan and as a fan of good, well made movies, The Lego Batman Movie is fantastic. Easily the best film of 2017 so far.
 Marlon I 	  Ahhhh. I loved it as much as The Lego Movie. Sorry but I cant describe how fantastic this one was.Grade: 10/10 100% (A+)
 Grant H 	  Amazing movie. Chock-full of brilliant references, outrageous humor, even more dazzling effects than its predecessor, and a stellar voice cast, especially Arnett, this love letter to the DC hero also does a wonderful job of featuring some magnificent character development and an introspective look at the vigilante.
 Mohd R 	  This movie was ultimately awesome. It was 2.6 billion times better than Batman V Superman.
 Steve W 	  The Lego Batman Movie attempts to keep the same style of tone and humour as its predecessor, but it sometimes implodes under its own chaotic nature. Batman is lonely and emotionally troubled in this version, and refuses to be part of a family. He can defeat his Rogues Gallery with ease but he's missing that certain something. When Joker steps up his game, its up to Lego Batman to save the day. The movie lacks focus in its own narrative by having Joker team up with all sort of movie villains, from Sauron to Voldemort, Gremlins and creatures from Ray Harryhausen films. Also the jokes are so rapidfire, that the jokes themselves even clash with each other, especially in one scene. The movie is all over the place, especially with fix to the big climax, which I felt was cheap and insulting. Lego Batma has plenty of inner jokes and references, solid animation, but it just needed to be reigned in, as it was very unhinged.
 Ricky P 	  Like it's predecessor The Lego Batman Movie is a hilariously fast paced ride with a charming voice cast, beautiful stop motion animation and a heart felt message
 Scott N 	  This movie was so clever. There are so many things to catch allowing for a great opportunity to rewatch it.
 Rose L 	  A true love letter to both the mythos of Batman and Lego this movie hits a lot of right notes. With in the first 10 minutes I knew this would be a great movie. The amount of Easter eggs in this movie grows exponentially from minute one, using nearly every character of Gotham (even the condiment king) and a few note worthy characters from the Lego franchise. Somehow this movie is more star studded than most live action iderations of Batman with; Will Arnet, Cera, Zack Galifenackis, and countless others. This movie gives a fleshed out look at the relationships that Batman has with out the hindrance of seriousness that other adaptations have had. The plot uses both the Lego and Batman worlds fully, while some how executing the idea of suicide squad better than the live action movie did earlier this year. I look forward to the Legofication of other properties with glee.
 Anthony R 	  It was a good movie, and had some funny moments. It certainly referenced Batman lore and history. It also had no problem picking fun at Batman. It did, however, fall a little flat towards the 3rd act. That being said, it was still the best Batman we have seen in the last 2 years.
 Desiree E 	  Great attention to details and ridiculousness.
 Jesse M 	  Kids want Their toys for movies, and luckily Hero has Come to Brick save the world From Joker plans take over brick city. The Lego Batman Movie is Everything is Awesome. Yeah it most Fun Kids Movie you watch their looking.
 Henry D 	  This movie is downright hilarious, action-packed, and overall entertaining
 Ralph D 	  Worst movie I've seen in a year.
 Maria M 	  the lego batman movie was great!??? Pretty cool & i loved it!-Andres 6 yrs old
 markus m 	  it was great for kids but not so good for pre-teen or higher
 April H 	  enjoyed, was very funny.
 Chris M 	  It was a really funny, super awesome and really action-packed animated family comedy adventure. It had really fantastic animation, really fabulous voice cast, really awesome action, lots of laughs, really awesome music, really great characters, really cool visuals and a really great story. This is going to be one of the best animated films of the year. I really recommend this movie to both kids and adults.
 chris h 	  After coming off a successful Lego movie that captured the hearts of even the highest of doubters, Lego attempts to make a spinoff of a character from the first movie. Normally spinoff movies are less than stellar, but this one packs as much imagination into a movie as a 5 year old with a brand new set of Legos. Without spoiling anything there are a few surprises throughout the movie that make this movie deviate from other movies with DC ties and it is not only very creative, it's so hilarious! But perhaps the biggest surprise for me is this movie isn't just a comedy for kids, it also has a lot of heart and a good plot. Clearly this wasn't just some spinoff just for monetary gain. All in all, if you like batman, know a lot or a little about him and you enjoyed the first Lego movie, you will love this movie. It's designed for kids but it's done so well anyone can enjoy it. I highly recommend anyone and everyone check it out.
 Harrison W 	  Way better than the time with two boats. Would be my favorite Batman if The Dark Knight weren't so good. Wish the humor stayed as good and consistent in the middle because the beginning had me crying. Loved all the CRAZY deep references and it was almost redeeming to hear Doug Benson as Bane.
 Paul T 	  A fun movie for all ages. With so many references, it seemed to cater more to adults that are familiar with the past incarnations of Batman. There were also some villains that I didn't expect and they were great to see. On top of the silliness, there was some touching scenes and good character development. This was a great watch.
 Udit C 	  The best DC movie since that other batman movie, which was the best DC movie since that other batman movie.. wow they're really milking this character aren't they?
 Rafael P 	  Fs de Batman, fs de comdia, fs de animao, fs de cultura pop: assistam!  excelente!!
 Amber P 	  OMG, this movie was amazeballs! It had so many Batman references, including some of the original villains from pre-1960s comic books. HILARIOUS. Plus, Lego didn't leave out any of the fandoms in this movie. There are fun references to Gremlins, LOTR, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, and Dr. Who. Will Arnett has got to be the best Batman ever! ***SPOILER ALERT*** I'm taking a half star off because they already had Ralph Fiennes voicing Alfred in the movie; so why not through a couple extra at him to do BOTH VOICES. He owns the spirit of that other character and it would have been better if he had voiced him. Just sayin...Other than that, I totally loved it.
 Gerard M 	  Standout animation with a great vibe
 Michael N 	  Best friends are family!
 Gael R 	  its the most awesome batman movie even better than the lego movie
 NOIR. E 	  not as entertaining as the first movie...
 Jacob D 	  A pretty good spin off with a lot of jokes for film buffs and kids just sometimes it seems overwhelming.
 That Awkward G 	  What a blast! The Lego Batman Movie was a fun and extremely entertaining ride that everyone can enjoy for different reasons! The voice acting, animation, structure, incredible blend of hilarious jokes and laughs, as well as touchy feely moments make this movie real special! Is it sad to say that I enjoyed this film more than any DC movie that's come out in the last couple years?! I don't care! I will be buying this to add to my collection! This movie was amazing in almost every possible way. There's some nitpicks here and there about pacing and overused jokes, but that's the extent of this movie's cons! Go see this movie! It's fantastic, and is a great animated comedy about the greatest comic book character of all time! There's something in here for little kids, adults, huge fans of the Batman character, pretty much anybody will find a nugget of awesomeness in this movie, know matter who they are! The Lego Batman Movie is a very colorful, beautifully animated, spoof comedy that everyone should see in theaters! BATMAN!!!!
 Alberto F 	  You will have a very good time all though, theres a part that i think batman was to harsh, but that doesn't make a bad movie
 Omar L 	  The joy of The LEGO Movie was the incorporation of the characters to service how imaginative using LEGO blocks could be. It spoke to what drives imagination and ingenuity. In this spinoff, LEGO actually takes a backseat to the deconstruction of Batman and his darkness. Unfortunately, the movie offers little that Batman fans have not seen before.
 Philippe M 	  story is a bit weak but there are a few good chuckles.
 Jonathan O 	  It was a beautifully fresh and amazing take on the Batman universe that fans and every one else needed. With all its comedy and really good life lesson in the end. The Lego Batman movie was great and deserves the ratings it's getting.
 Jennifer B 	  Awesome best time had in movie ever better than the lego movie being the whole family run don't walk to the theater
 Tracy S 	  After the success of The Lego Movie, it was only a matter of time before we would see the inevitable spinoffs and now that time has come. The first spinoff has arrived in the form of The Lego Batman Movie and while it does sport a good story and some fun moments, this movie doesn't exactly live up to the hype and feels like a mediocre movie rather than an awesome movie. The story revolves around Batman as he is trying to come to terms with letting other people help him as The Joker leads a band of villains to attack Gotham city. Simple, for sure, but it honestly works for the most part. It has some valuable life lessons that you don't really see in animated movies often and that leads to some really heartfelt moments. There is also a plethora of Bat-easter eggs that will keep Batman fans of all ages excited and smiling throughout the entireity of the film.This leads to the major issue of the film: the emptiness. The film starts off with a 15 minute scene of perfection. It is fast paced, hilarious, and reminds you of what these Lego movies are capable of. However after that the film slams on breaks and the great moments become few and far between. There is so much forced humor that you get tired of it and the story is so simple that it really doesn't warrant the big screen treatment. I often felt bored while watching this and was begging for the first scene to start over so I could get the film I wanted to see. It is almost like the writers became more focused on easter eggs rather than genuine development as in the down time is where majority of the easter eggs are found.The film however does redeem itself in the third act as it finally finds itself and the film really hammers in the message behind it in grand fashion. The emotional pay off is surprising and you end up enjoying the film more than you where. It is still however baffling that the film makes you wait till the third act to get some form of gratification for watching the film. In all honesty, if you had told me the film would have ended as well as it did in the middle of it I would have laughed at you. However it is a testament to the direction of the film that it overcame the issues and ended on a high note.The animation as a whole is gorgeous and really show how intricate we can make these films. The way the characters move to when they are constructing things is a blast to watch. I also like the way the animation really has improved over the original Lego movie. There isn't anymore adjusting to the motions and you get into the film, visually, a lot quicker than you did in the first film. Add in some very small and incredibly intricate details and you get some of the best animation in film today.The voice cast is also great with Will Arnett as Batman. His voice talent is great and he really has fun with the role. Rosario Dawson plays Barbara Gordon and adds a bit of finesse to the role. Michael Cera had an interesting role as Robin and he really overcame it. He made it his own and really added innocence where the role previously had none. Zach Galifianakis plays The Joker and is the highlight of the cast. He added something we haven't seen in the role yet and did the best he could with the script he had. Ralph Fiennes plays Alfred and while he did fine, you can't help but feel he plays it a bit too close to the chest.All in all Lego Batman Movie is just okay. The story is there, cast and animation are great, but there is so much emptiness throughout the film that you really get bored. More power to the writers for making the ending work, but the middle is just so baron it is mind-boggling that it got green lit in this condition. However, despite that it is still worth recommending for the great moments sprinkled in it but only at matinee price.
 Ruben M 	  Can't go wrong with Legos & Batman!
 Kate H 	  Great fun but I missed "Ev'rything is awesome!"
 Bethany B 	  Loved it, took my 9 YO Grandson.
 Demetre R 	  3. Total little kids movie. I honestly almost paid to go see this movie because I thought they were going to do a great job with it. However, it was only mildly interesting playing in the background of my TV as I stream it for free.
 Shawn L 	  Enjoyable overall with funny moments but it's in your face the whole time and can become tedious. My toddler got restless in the theater and I can't really blame her.
 Andrew F 	  Fun and entertaining.
 Bob B 	  Great for kids. Super funny for parents.
 Snow B 	  Super fun and hilarious
 Daniel W 	  Good kids movie, but overrated. After the music action scene solo it goes downhill. It gets bogged down in children movies clichs and is fairly one-note, that being of the power of friendship. It dumbs down all the characters, but also deconstructs Batman, which I did think was a neat twist. Being an actual Batman fan, I understand why they did what they did. To make Batman even a bit more serious would then create a situation where it is too much trouble to develop him. Plus, it is a kids movie. (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD) Most of the humor that isn't self-aware is poor children's humor that an adult cannot enjoy (for instance, the bad guys later team-up, which by the way, you know is going to happen, because The Joker was "mean" to them). The Joker feels insanely out of character to a point where he isn't even The Joker. They try to do this arch-nemesis angle, but even for a kid-friendly Joker he doesn't act like a Joker. He doesn't challenge Batman through his own design. At the start, he just rounded up all the villains (it opens this way, so there is nothing there aside from a villain alliance already, which is fine) then later he just kind of knows that he can free all the villains from the Phantom Zone? There really isn't any logic and that is fine for a kids movie, but just fine. It is not a great movie over all. Aside from that, I was often bored. I found myself wondering how much it cost to make, because the stop motion wasn't always that well done. There were so many blurry lines and images. Why is that left in? Movies also need to stop beating us over the head with this "girl power" nonsense. Just have the women be strong, pointing it out is like saying they aren't strong enough to stand on their own.
 Stephen C 	  Maybe not the best Batman movie ever made, but certainly the best movie ever made about Batman.
 Tom D 	  Realy funny and cool but ,,Lego movie" had better story.
 Tony S 	  Smart, Fun and Funny. For and/or adults.
 Martin A 	  This movie is an absolute blast. Even though the jokes and concepts are overstated, its a fun ride with good characters, a fresh plot and a new, witty take on the Joker, as well as Batmans aides: Dick Grayson (Robin) Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) and Alfred, voiced brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes. Its hilarious and it is completely worth your time, adult or child.
 Jacob H 	  This film is amazing I can,t wait to watch more Lego cinematic universe films in the future
 Kevin B 	  Really funny better than the lego movie
 Gary G 	  A little predictable and not as clever as original lego movie. My wife enjoyed it more than I did and she usually doesn't like these movies so maybe I was expecting too much.
 Isaac M 	  While it may not be as good as the original LEGO movie, it was still a fun movie. The story has a good telling of Batman's everyday life, animation looks fantastic, and the characters are funny, and well-developed. My rating: Story: 80% Animation: 100%Characters: 80%Movie: 90%
 Chris W 	  What an awesome movie! I love all the Easter eggs to the previous Batman live action films. Witty and beyond humorous! This is a must see!
 Pablo C 	  The best Batman movie of all time...
 Aseem K 	  One watch is just not enough...In a really long time, a film whose repeat value is so high... Totally ready to follow Batman and may be learn life lessons on the way..
 David M 	  I'll admit: despit being my favourite childhood toy, I never thought that Lego would be the source for a good movie.A belief which I was proved wrong with in the 2014 movie 'The Lego Movie': one of the stand-out stars of which was Will Arnett's ridiculously gravelly-voiced (and egotistic) Batman.As such, it's no surprise that he would be the first character to get his own spin-off movie, the enterity of which (unlike the Lego Movie) takes place 'in-universe' (so no fourth-wall breaking coda towards the end) and which see Lego Batman - aided by a slew of other Batman-related characters (initally against his own wishes) - take on the Lego Joker (yep) and other pop-culture related villains, with the story going down the 'family-is-good' route.Not quite as good as it's forebear' althuogh this one also makes plenty of references to previous Live-action Batman escapades: if anything, the film is almost a bit too frenetic for it's own good.
 Anthony C 	  Good kids movie, but isn't really a great adult kids movie, if that makes any sense.
 POTTSY v 	  Visually stunning, the set pieces were fantastic. It was more funny than I expected. I loved how they references all the other batman movies! The entire cast was also great, especially Will Arnett as batman. The only minor problem is that the pacing it is a little too fast.
 ????? ? 	  This is bomb, very nice film
 versifinian . 	  Slow most of the movie, there are quite a few funny lines but many already shared in the previews.
 Charles K. B 	  AWESOMESAUCE!!!! I love how they show kids how important trust & friendship is. And you know..... BATMAN!!!
 Jason C 	  Love it! Great story line!
 Jess C 	  From the opening credits this movie just kept the laughs rolling in. Kinda funny they accidentally made a better suicide squad movie than suicide squad... and found a way to add batgirl and robin in a cool way. The action scenes were also top notch, these animators obviously had carte blanche to create whatever they had rattling around in their heads.. and it so paid off in every way possible. The digs they took at other cultural things/movies, including the older batman films, were great and too many to list... "Ironman Sucks!" If you liked the characterization of batman from lego movie you will love this movie.
 D371N 5 	  This movie is hilarious. However I think it goes too quickly with it's characters, for example, as soon as Batman and Batwomen team up she calls themselves the bat family, but you just teamed up. Anyway besides a couple minor points this movie is great and I laughed my ass off.
 Eddie H 	  Awesome fun movie. Live action Batman take note
 Thomas L 	  A fun piece of fluff so jam packed with stuff that the artistry of the stop motion animation gets lost. Will Arnett's Batman IS Awesome!
 Sherwine M 	  The Lego Batman Movie is arguably the most enjoyable and different batman movie i have seen. It is very funny, fast paced, and is also expressing Batman's story in an emotional and unexpected way that made this movie even better. My only issue with Lego Batman is Joker himself, I felt like his voice-acting didn't have anything special or great, it felt to me that anyone could have voice-acted him in this case. But overall I really enjoyed Lego Batman and found it better than The Lego Movie. 8.8/10
 Gary K 	  Great flick for parents as much as the kids!
 Lee M 	  Between a 7/10 and 8/10, The Lego Batman Movie works precisely because it knows audiences are sick of its hero. It's a reassessment, an intervention, an effort to try and remember what's fun about him.
 Nancy L 	  A fun warm movie full of love and humor
 Brandon C 	  Not as great as the original Lego movie but it's a must see for any Batman fan. Great humor for kids and adults to enjoy. 83/100.
 Ki-seon P 	  Hilarious, fast paced, and loads of fun, the makers of Lego Batman clearly understand the character of Batman, delivering nothing but grins and smiles through out the movie.
 Teresa S 	  The jokes fell flat and it seemed like this one wasn't as thought out at the first Lego movie.
 Joseph M 	  awesome movie all around; must see for everyone.
 Chris B 	  perfect kids movie for adults. Ellie and I both laughed really hard.
 Justin P 	  Not as funny as some critics are saying, but a very fun movie. Love seeing so many characters and seeing a cartoony take on the batman lore
 Dennis H 	  Amazing story, writing, absolutely clever and entertaining for all audiences regardless of age. Masterful work.
 Megan W 	  I never regret seeing these lego movies! They're very well written!
 Therron H 	  I want to see it! Best movie ever!
 Jason S 	  Best Batman movie ever.
 Mario C 	  Una de las pelculas ms graciosas del ao. Excelente animacin e historia. Demuestran que no se necesitan chistes vulgares y absurdos para hacer rer. Los fans de Batman encontraran varias referencias a cmics, pelculas y series. Mejor verla en ingls.
 cathy m 	  this looks like a cute movie but don't have any young ones to take and 74 year old lady would be funnier than the movie....need to have senior day only at least 1 day so we can enjoy these cute movies
 Richard P 	  Great Batman movie, all our favourites are here plus some other legendary baddies too! Well worth a punt! Nearly as good as last years Everything is Awesome one!
 Liam H 	  a very fun and funny animated movie, I especially enjoyed all the throwbacks/homage to classic Batman TV show
 Judson H 	  Such a great movie! Really funny and some great Batman Easter eggs! I need to get me a copy of the "Let's Get Nuts" mixtape!
 Shawn R 	  Batman bliss...?????????
 Matthew R 	  DC fans rejoice! Loved the white rabbits for the adults. Loved the comedy for the kids. Joker- not so much.. but what can you do?
 isaac H 	  At first i was skeptical but in my opinion this is better than Dark Knight and Batman (1989) which are my favorite Batman movies beside this. This was possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen
 Sam C 	  The Lego Batman movie takes a big slice of what made the Lego Movie so popular and adds the Batman DC universe to the party. The script is loaded with in jokes and funny sequences which will be farmed for memes for the rest of the year. It's also a really good Batman film and Will Arnett shares his voice talent superbly in the lead role. Also Michael Cera fitting in with an annoyingly cheerful sidekick make this movie hard not to like even in its weakest moments.
 Jeff S 	  Movie has a lot of great references and a few good laughs. However, its universal praise seems to be more of a response to the DCEU than a judgement of the actual movie. This movie doesn't do anything new that any Batman movie, cartoon, or comic hasn't done in the past. It just throws subtlety out the window and beats you over the head with it. Has some fun parts but left feeling both over and under stimulated.
 Remi V 	  This movie is an ad for Legos. That being said, it's a pretty good ad
 Jon H 	  This movie is somewhat funny but inundated with social engineering propaganda. Very disappointing.
 Andrei G 	  Lego continues with their right moves making this new spin-off installment as lovable as The Lego Movie.
 Bradley S 	  Kids and I LOVED it. Another win by Lego and WB
 James K 	  In 2014, Warner Bros. completely surprised audiences with "The Lego Movie"; a film based off a toy line that actually worked. Now, three years later, we have a spin-off with one of the major characters from the previously mentioned film: Batman. Yes, this is "The Lego Batman Movie", and it's just as silly as it sounds. However, there is are a few problems that sets this film apart from "The Lego Movie", which we'll get into a minute. But if you want to have a fun time at the theaters, then "The Lego Batman Movie" is right up your alley.The story involves Batman (Will Arnett) being a hero, and saving Gotham City, as always. Every criminal Batman defeats, like The Joker (Zach Galifianakis), he always gets a hero's welcome when he returns home. Or does he? Batman must learn to work together as part of a team, or else something malicious just might bring about his downfall."The Lego Batman Movie" is a fun and entertaining romp for about an hour and 40 minutes. There are quite a lot of jokes that audiences will get, especially fans of Batman, that will definitely get a good laugh. On top of this, there is a wide assortment of characters that everyone can find charming and enjoyable. Especially Batman. Will Arnett does a great job at poking fun at the Caped Crusader as well as bringing some depth to the role. Even the supporting cast that includes Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, and Ralph Fiennes, all do great jobs with the roles they are given. There's even a few surprising cameos that if you're really careful, will get a smile on your face.The music is good as it delivers the action that the character of Batman is known for. As mentioned previously, the run time (without end credits), is about 90 minutes, and the pacing doesn't feel like it is being dragged down. The same can be said for the editing as all of the action is exciting and thrilling, just the way it should be.But what really stands out is the animation. Yes, it does look like everything is in CG, but that's the charm of the film. It does have a fakeness to it, yet it's so beautifully detailed, you have to re-watch the movie just to see all of the attention to detail.Despite everything, the movie does have one or two problems. First off, the lesson that the character of Batman learns is pretty simple and basic. It is a good lesson about getting help from people, even when you don't need it. But it's pretty obvious within the first couple of minutes what the lesson is. Also, while most of the characters are fun, Batman himself is kind of a jerk; it's not until he learns his lesson does he become a sympathetic character.In conclusion, "The Lego Batman Movie" is a fun little experience that, while may not have the same charm and wit as "The Lego Movie", still offers up some really good entertainment for those who enjoy Batman.
 Nick D 	  a lot of innuendo between Batman and the Joker, but a visual feast of color and action. lot of adult jokes but a great romp for all ages
 Mostafa A 	  EPIC. EPIC. EPIC. The best Batman since The Dark Knight.
 Dillon L 	  funny and with a lot of heart loved it
 Letitia i 	  it is very good better then the first one
 Peter C 	  The Lego Batman Movie is more than just a kiddy batman movie or comedy fest, it is everything batman is well known for in his past successful movies with Lego's own twist on it.
 Xian Guang T 	  An awesome movie filled with tons of Easter Eggs and humor, definitely would be a great film for all walks of life. Plus, it is a Dc and LEGO movie. It has it's own formula, trying hard not to like the original LEGO movie and is a great spin-off movie on it's own. It's worth the money you spent.
 Rob B 	  Best joke to slip past studio exec's eyes: Alfred driving the the manor's limo; license plate: "Wayne Car".
 Jeff S 	  I enjoyed it and kid loved it.
 Carl N 	  My first animated film in a theater, Batman superfans & geeks you will thoroughly enjoy the subtle nods, references and jokes. A fun movie.
 Reel Life R 	  No, YOU teared up at a movie filled with cartoon legos! We went back and forth whether we'd see this one, and had even officially removed it from our movie list for the year. But a random Thursday night and a movie voucher changed that. There are some hilarious moments in this movie. I expected to like some jokes, but I didn't think I would be laughing out loud. There were some definite misses peppered in where no one in any of the age groups laughed that were present. There were more of these instances than I would have liked. Another question mark for me was, well, the fact that they're legos. But I never really gave it another thought after the first couple scenes. They were pretty clever in how they incorporated it. There is an excellent message about the importance of family and friends in this movie. And did I mention the 80's music?? I think the use of that upped the score another half a point for me. Overall this movie was a great surprise and should appeal to all ages.
 Angelina R 	  3.75Humerus play scenarios with amusing movie plot; creative Lego effects and character costumes yet keep the squares effects of original Lego theme
 Ashwin A 	  Thinking of doing something different this weekend, then this the movie u wanna see.
 Mark S 	  What an absolute bore.
 alex h 	  It was awesome, funny, and i loved the references.
 Ryan V 	  The Lego Movie seemed like a crappy, overlong toy commercial on paper, but director Chris McKay somehow made it into a surprisingly entertaining sleeper hit. One of the best parts of that movie was how its version of Batman was a hilarious piss-take on the incredibly self-serious Christopher Nolan incarnation of the character, so the next obvious step was to have McKay return to helm a vehicle focusing on Lego Batman. This movie finds the Dark Knight unable to foil an elaborate plot by the Joker until he admits that he needs friends to help him out. Like the Lego Movie, it's a briskly-paced crowd-pleaser with plenty of cheeky humor, inside jokes, snappy animation, and a cast of movie star voice actors who seem to be enjoying themselves. Overall, it's a fun and endlessly rewatchable romp for kids, casual movie goers, and Batjunkies alike.
 Jason K 	  Probably the worst animated movie I've seen in years! Story was ok, animation was second class. I fell asleep a few times and ended up listening to music on my phone. My three boys like the movie.
 Blake P 	  As the ending credits rolled and I discovered that "The LEGO Batman Movie," the highly anticipated sequel to 2014's near perfect "The LEGO Movie," was written by no less than five screenwriters, I found myself distinctly unsurprised. Carrying its predecessor's clever self-referentiality but not its effortless ability to induce wheezing, oftentimes tearful laughter, it's more manufactured product than blockbusting comic masterpiece. Smartly manufactured product, mind you, but manufactured product all the same. And nothing pieced together on an assembly line ever really satisfies.  Stuffed wall to wall with both sight and verbal gags, self-effacing cracks, and sniggering one-liners, "The LEGO Batman Movie" makes for an odd case. It's in on the joke that it exists purely to lift the money lining the pockets of parents around the world, but it also can't help but resist eventually trading its barbed knowingness for the formulaic middle and final acts to have similarly characterized other films resting in the Batman cannon. Consider it intelligent and hackneyed, like an "Avengers" movie that still manages to get trapped in a finale that we've indefinitely seen before. But the film isn't without its charms, and its comic sophistication gets it mostly far, if not as luminously so as the 2014 masterstroke that came before it. "The LEGO Batman Movie," as its title suggests, gives "The LEGO Movie" side character Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) his own movie. With direct references to every single undertaking within the Batman world (there are even jabs aimed directly at the Adam West starring series of the 1960s), it's simultaneously a spoof and a universe expansion.  Here, all the action's centered around Batman's attempts to steal Superman's (Channing Tatum) Phantom Zone Projector (a machine able to transport baddies into a high in the sky, inescapable prison) to finally defeat his arch-nemesis, The Joker (Zach Galifianakis), and around the arrival of Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson), the new police chief who threatens Batman's standing as Gotham's greatest hero. But the storyline's mostly a mechanism to keep all the jokes from getting whisked away into self-pleasuring aimlessness. What the film's really about is Batman's determination to stay an antisocial loner for the rest of his life, and the in-the-making deconstruction of his inability to form meaningful relationships. Much of "The LEGO Batman Movie's" comic output spotlights the humorous juxtaposition between Batman's unyielding habit of taking himself much too seriously and the theatrical - almost slapstick - cheeriness of the people trying to insinuate themselves into his life. Even The Joker wants his greatest combatant to admit that he needs him. Yet only the film's first act matches "The LEGO Movie's" awe-inspiring ability to make absurd, noticeably juvenile comedy radiant. It inspires more giggles than guffaws. And in comparison to the way the first "The LEGO Movie" had countless moments that evoked the stomach aches felt after seeing Lucy and Ethel's chocolate factory mishap for the first time, "The LEGO Batman Movie" is merely canny. It knows exactly what it is, aware of its limitations and its capacity to get away with flavorsome silliness. But it's also too dependent on predicability to allow for its wisecracks to really stick, and so we're left smiling when our knees should be red from all the slaps that should have made way. Here's to hoping another sequel is kept on the shelf to curb further loss of freshness.
 Scott D 	  Best Lego movie ever. Taking on the Leftist agenda and exposing it for the farce that it is was pure genius. Brilliant. Deserves Best Picture Oscar next year.
 AW C 	  While not all the humor lands (including the endless self-referential "I'm Batman" "jokes"), The Lego Batman Movie succeeds with it's developed characters, sly comedy, and gorgeous animation.
 Kebafh A 	  I LOVED this movie. The BEST movie ever! I want MORE LEGO BATMAN!
 Harrison A 	  Lego Batman is proof that there still can be good DC films. At times the tone of the film can be a little off, but mostly it knows how to balance humor and heart. It's a wonderful film for the whole family to enjoy. Go see this in theaters and show support to filmmakers who actually try to make a good movie.
 Genesis C 	  the lego batman movie review?
 Krista K 	  Was dancing and singing to the songs loved it so much.
 Joseph N 	  Anything that isn't Batman V Superman is good enough for me.
 Marc-Andr D 	  Not as good as the lego movie, but still rather entertaining, the inclusion of guest characters was interesting, and it had a really nice balance of funny and serious moments
 Mark D 	  Sooooooo funny. What a great movie on all levels. Best Batman ever.
 Rob C 	  Made for a social justice snowflake generation. I expected more.
 Thomas R 	  Brilliant. It's brilliant. And it doesn't really need me to say it, because everyone else is saying it, but this is so much better than batman vs superman. Not because of its "tone" or because it's funny (though it is) but because it's a great, well constructed film that makes you care about batman. And it's so entertaining along the way. Just great fun. Watch it!
 George I 	  Started out wildly hilarious, ended feeling kinda maudlin, like the sappy ending of an episode of a 1970's sitcom, after a valuable lesson has been learned. The first 30-45 minutes (approx) was the movie I wanted to see. The rest of it was some old bullshit.
 Matthew H 	  The Best Lego movie I ever seen.and one of my favorite top 5 Batman movies.
 Stephen B 	  Absolutely brilliant movie with a fantastic opening sequence. Laughed so much it hurt and have to say one of the best Batman films made!
 Zack S 	  Its kind of ridiculous how great this movie is. It's the best Batman parody made by the company that made Batman. An unexpected hit.
 Stephen B 	  this was a funny film which did not take it self sericerley void for a laugh but not as good as the first 2 films
 Jason B 	  it was good but, differently a kids movie. like under 10. I like cartoons but, wouldn't watch this again; not even for free on dvd.
 Private U 	  Despues de el intento de solemnidad le caia bien este refresacamiento al encapotado de Gotica.
 Shaheer S 	  I really enjoyed the movie and there was a moral to the story and that was: teamwork
 Michael R 	  The Lego Batman Movie is big, loud, fun and full of heart. Brimming with in-jokes and easter eggs from the 75 plus years of Batman lore, The Lego Batman Movie feels fresh and exciting. A Must see for anyone who deems themselves a Batman fan.
 Danny S 	  The Movie Plays Homage To All The Batman Movies And The 1966 TV Show. . Great Cast Voices And Story. Is A Very Funny Movie . I Would Recommend This Movie To You. Fun For The Whole Family.
 Jorban J 	  The opening sequence was a 10, then the rest of the movie was a big ol' deuce.
 Kameron W 	  I'm sure I'll love it more on repeat viewings which is exactly the same way I am with The Lego Movie.
 Jonathon B 	  It has all the bright, sometimes overwhelming, pizazz of LEGO Movie, but with a more predictable and less introspective finale. Definitely more for children than it's predecessor, which found a happy balance between deep content and slapstick fun. This one contents itself with poking fun at its main character, which for hardcore batman fans will both delight and annoy. Galifanakis was a strange pick for the joker, but they seems to have made a point that none of the bad guys should be scary or really evil, which reduces the weight of the conflict. All in all it was a fun smile filled ride that could've been better.
 Derek H 	  a very interesting plot. Even better then the other lego movie
 Dwight O 	  A must see for the whole family and it doesn't let you down. It is funny, clever for all ages! Lots of Easter eggs from previous Batman movies and even a nod at the original 60's TV series! Your kids will love it and you will find yourself laughing as well! Go see it!
 Andrew H 	  Lego + Batman - Ben Affleck = Great Movie!
 Jay A 	  Lots of fun with nods to every Batman movie and villain ever---plus the old TV show, and a few characters you've never seen before. Frenetic pace with many one-liners, but good writing and an actual story keep things interesting! Even the Daleks from Dr. Who make an appearance.
 Andrew O 	  Almost excessively fast paced without the surprisingly affecting drama of its predecessor, it's a really fun adventure even though I wish it played more by its own terms.
 Ian G 	  The Lego Batman movie acts as a double sequel/franchise film of sorts since it falls under both the Lego Movie universe as it references the real world portal laying underneath Gotham city aka the table the world is built on, as well as the master build formula, along with the obvious Batman universe that it reference ad infinitum whether it be the movie universe all the way back to the Adam West '66 film. Its pretty cleaver with being able to reinvent the Bat franchise and making it fun again especially in light of the all too serious Zack Snyderverse, incorporating the ridiculous back cannon such as the Condiment King, Calender Man and some of the other E list villains from its campy days, to bringing light to the brooding nature of the character etc, and also Jerry Maguireing the relationship with the Joker how they need each other, delightfully playing on the you complete me line from the Dark Knight. The piece de resistance was when the Joker makes it to the Phantom Zone was being able to incorporate other famous WB and Universal villains to the proceedings from the Wicked Witch, Bruce the Shark, Sauron and the Gremlins to act as his henchmen to help take over Gotham. It really helps to capture the sense of play and fun from the first entry. Between this and the ever expansive nooks and cranies of the Batcave that realty has fun showing off every single Bat transpo from plane to kayak, The Lego Batman is going to be fun for every Batman fan and kid at heart. Aces
 Jorge Mauricio M 	  Very cool. As the first Lego movie Ive seen, I must admit I have felt nostalgic for the type of toy. The movie has been fun and worth it, although it is short
 Tom B 	  Fast paced humour. One of the best spoof films in years, and it's Lego!
 Mina N 	  Alright the lego movie surprised me by being an excellent movie so we'vegot the lego batman movie will be as good as the lego movie? That's what we will know firstly i liked all the voice actors they were persuasive specially zach galifianakis as the joker i didn't expect that i would love him as the joker for me he is the 4th best joker after jared leto cayse heath ledger is the best and mark hamill after him screenplay was great it presented comedy,action,and drama in a great way but my only problem is in a scene something said in the future it has to happen and something else happened i liked the songs but keep in mind that there is a short lego movie right before the movie it was so silly and boring try not to pay attention at it but my score is 9.5/10
 Ronnie L 	  Fun for kids and adults...
 Daniel S 	  Had a few Lol moments it was good, the first one was a little better.
 Andy D 	  Although there were cool in-jokes; as a lifelong Batfan I just couldn't get into a film that ridiculed everything I hold dear.
 Miguel G 	  Joyous; a treat to watch in a theatre in 4DX and Real3D
 Jacob S 	  The Lego Batman Movie has its heart in the right place and for a younger audience, they will find it really enjoyable. There is still much to the film causal fans will enjoy as well but for me, while I did like it, I didn't love it as much as the first film. Hopefully, The LEGO team can polish up their flaws before their coming releases or they could be run into the novelty of this series getting really old, really fast.
 Bernardo D 	  Holy spins offs Batman... Even when its hard to believe The Lego Batman movie have as much heart as it predecesor with a little extra of abbs
 Jonathan A 	  Over the top almost to a fault, Lego batman still pulls itself together to be a solid flick.
 Robert M 	  if the whole movie was like the first opening minutes my rating would have been better. i found myself bored hopong for an ending. in fact it was so boring the person i brought with me fell asleeo several times throughout the movie. so its a total waste of money. this lego movie shames the franchise as the games they make are entertaining and fun.
 Bradley C 	  Good funny family show for all ages
 Iqbal A 	  is'nt dark is a comedy but this is amazing the great eve lego and batman film.
 James R 	  What another great Lego film. A sort of spin off from 2014's The Lego Movie this film centers around the self centered Batman from the same film. Batman (Will Arnett) fights crime and is very good at it. After defeating the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) once again he retires to his mansion. Batman deep down is longing for a family, but never wants to lose them like he did with his parents. His butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) insists that he needs to get out more and realize what he is really missing. During an attack on the new commissioner Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) the Joker gives up which seemingly makes Batman useless. Along with a young boy named Dick Grayson (Michael Cera) Batman works to uncover what the Joker is really up to while also realizing that maybe being part of a team and having a family isn't the worst thing that could happen. First off this movie is absolutely hilarious! More so if you get the Batman references and Easter Eggs strewn throughout the film. There's an obvious great message about friends and family here and I have to say the voice actors nail it. Will Arnett goes for the gruff egotistic Batman while Michael Cera's boyish Robin is a great pair up for the two. My only gripe is that the second act is just a little slow. Overall, if you enjoyed the Lego Movie, or are a Batman fan go out and check this one out!
 Angel Z 	  this is one if the best batman movies ever, I hope you'll enjoy this film as much as I did!!!
 DeVaughn B 	  Seriously a blast. One thing I'll always give credit to Warner Bros. for is their animation team's work. Lego Batman perfectly blended children's humor with adult, plenty of easter eggs and references, homages to past films and tv series (ALL of them), cameos and gags the kids wouldn't understand. Maybe Warner Bros. should just make all of their DC films Lego... it can't hurt them. At all. A bit fast-paced though, and the jokes after jokes after jokes can get old a bit fast when this film actually has a great Batman story behind it, the Lego aspect and immature child's film holds it back at times.
 Riquelme s 	  Acredito que, Lego Batman seja uma inspirao para os futuros filmes da DCU e da Lego.
 Mario K 	  Best movie ever but short
 John P 	  Lego has done it again. They've created a hilarious, action packed, wildly entertaining piece of pure awesomeness by combining everything that worked in their last movie with an over the top deconstruction of the superhero genre and making everyone's favorite superhero/supporting character from the last movie the star.Batman is awesome. You know, I know it, and boy does he ever know it. He beats the bad guys. All the bad guys! At once! He has the coolest moves, the coolest gadgets, the coolest, biggest, fastest vehicles. He has the best secret base of any superhero. Period. People love him. They want to be him. He will tell you this, often. He may be the most arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed hero since Stirling Archer, with whom he shares a serious fear of commitment. The only thing missing from his perfectly awesome life is someone to share it with.But that won't last for long, because this movie is really about the importance of family and changing as a person and all that stuff, which is driven home as ham fistedly and with as little subtlety as possible, because this movie doesn't understand the concept of subtlety. Every personally is dialed up to 11. Every bit of the narrative is told as broadly and absurdly as it can be. The self-sustaining, semi codependent cycle of violence between Batman and the Joker is hilariously reduced to a sappy anti romance, with the words "I hate you" bringing catharsis.And the laughs just keep on coming. As in the last Lego movie the jokes are mile a minute. There's slapstick, puns, and humorous guest appearances by every hero and villain Warner Brothers has the right to. There are references galore to current and past pop culture, Batman comics and movies, and even to the hokey plot devices being employed. At times Lego Batman is more self-referential than Tarantino. Nor is it the kind of movie to waste time getting started. In fact it may be the first movie in which the jokes start before the movie does. As before, the entire film operates on Lego Logic (copyright pending) in which anything can be broken down and rebuilt into anything else. Besides the obvious comedic fodder, this serves to further some of the most ridiculous plot points in an extremely ridiculous movie. As in more ridiculous than the giant random dance-off MC'd by Robin. There's virtually nothing this movie can't make work, because with the awesomeness of Lego and Batman combined everything is possible and logic and reason simply don't matter. So by all means go and see it. It may be the hardest you'll laugh all year.
 Brad R 	  If you're a Batman fan, this is required viewing. Holy Batman tribute, Batman!If you're not a Batman fan, you'll still have a great time, I promise.5 stars!
 Thomas N 	  very good kid friendly movie. even the adults loved it
 Matthew R 	  Entertainingly silly but less dynamic than The LEGO Movie as it wears a bit thin later on. However, as with its predecessor, it may reward repeat viewing in the future.
 Tatsuhito K 	  This might just be the most touching Batman movie ever made. The animation is top-notch, it has such great energy, and the jokes are consistently funny. I loved some of the voice acting and I had a good time watching it overall. Although it doesn't have the kind of bullshit ending that "The Lego Movie" had and it has some really positive, heartwarming messages, it does drag at times and there are a few things in the film that felt predictable. It starts out really strong but then slows down pretty quickly. Not a great film, but still a very entertaining one.
 micki p 	  waste of time and money. I have seen so many movies and all of them are better than this one!
 Nora J 	  Really enjoyed it. There was humor?, sadness, love, action and a valuable life lesson for any age. When I saw it the crowd was mainly young adults And they seemed to really like it. Well done movie.
 Amir Leo H 	  I must say its good movie, but it felt like cash cow ... no real felling no attachment at all.. its good but as soon as you went out from cinema...all is forgottenAnd box office is way lower than Lego movie ...so im not sure that im gonna be in cinema for next Lego movie
 Abel C 	  Not as good as the original Lego movie but it was still funny.
 Ash B 	  Simply the best Batman film (or film with Batman in) since 2008 and definitely the funniest Batman film ever. I literally spent 90% of this film laughing, but admittedly some of that time I was laughing whilst most of the audience remained silent because of the sheer quantity of "in" jokes. It's like the film works on 3 levels, the slapstick and obvious humour for the kids, the more subtle wordplay for the adults and the more obscure stuff for the geeks.
 Michael B 	  It was really good and funny.
 Jon C 	  the creators of the 'LEGO' Movie bring another adorable, funny entry into their collectionthis spinoff focuses on the caped crusader and his single-minded, narcissismgreat voice acting from Will Arnett to Ralph Fiennes to Michael Cera to Zach Galifinakis to Rosairo Dawson Batman saves Gotham from the worst bad guys but he thinks himself as more of a solo act when it comes to being the best; even the Joker is hurt by the fact that he doesn't think of him as his worst enemyAlfred tries to make him see that having someone close is just as important so when Robin is unexpectedly adopted by Bruce Wayne/Batman it's his chance to be just as good as well as a key member of family that Batman seems to be lackingBarbara Gordon wants to serve true justice by working with Batman despite his rejection of the ideathere's so many funny jokes, clever references and classic throwbacks to previous incarnations of the DC comic character's historyfans will spot so many easter eggs and newcomers will gobble up the animation of this toy brandit's important that we don't have to face things alone, people may go but that doesn't mean we should stop letting them in, and it's ok to change things this movie definitely pokes fun at the fact that we all love Batman even if it's overkill
 Micah T 	  Rampant homosexuality and some pedophilia; if you want your kid thinking having two dad's is the way to go then this is a movie for you and your little one. Other than that I really liked the animation style and jokes. I stayed for the whole thing because I didn't want to ruin the movie for my date.
 Alistair D 	  No doubt fun as a kids' movie, full of romp and silly humour but it requires stressing that this is a lego movie written by people who know kids, not a batman movie by batman people given a kiddie spin. I made the mistake of believing the latter going into it, mistakes were made. If you have kids, absolutely it's fun if a little drawn out, losing its way in the second half; otherwise I'd give it a miss. I get that it's a parody, I get it shouldn't be taken seriously but I found it a less than thrilling experience I won't be repeating.
 Tristan G 	  Utterly brilliant! Plenty for the adults too!
 Leslie I 	  Finally a DC movie that doesn't SUCK!
 Ruadhan M 	  Love DC. Love Batman. Love Lego. Love Lego Movie. Love Will Arnett. Love Michael Cera. Love LEGO BATMAN MOVIE
 Andrew K 	  Best movie the logo batsman I like it
 Ilja S 	  Self aware, fun poking, breath taking and incredibly funny, The Lego Batman Movie is another jewel in the Lego Fanchise, and will please all sorts of audiences. A little convoluted by the end, but that's all great stuff.
 Loren B 	  For whatever reason, we were bored silly with this movie. Batman was annoying rather than funny and.... it just stretch the "bit" on for too long.
 Dave C 	  Perhaps the greatest irony of The Lego Batman Movie's success comes from the fact that it succeeds by making fun of itself. The writers go so far as to use the general public backlash against these films to create a rather ingenious self-parody. Even if you appreciated Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad (I liked the first, deplored the second), it would be rather difficult (I assume) to not appreciate the level of humor this provides. It is one of the best Batman films to come out in a long while. Which brings me to an important part of any discussion of this film- is it a Lego Movie or a Batman movie, and if I appreciate one, will I appreciate the other? I think the answer it yes on all accounts, although with one caveat. If you are a superhero fan, and in-particular fan, you will likely be over the moon for this film. This film was written for you and you alone (the sheer depth that it goes to purge the Batman universe is insane). If you are not there is a possibility you will grade this slightly lower than The Lego Movie of 2015. But that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it or can't enjoy it almost as much. I know that there is another stand alone lego movie planned to be released next year (Ninjago). I have a feeling an apt comparison here will be that Ninjago will end up being an onslaught of inside jokes for kids, while Lego Batman is most certainly inside jokes for adults. And I think that is perfectly fine. It might lose a few kids attention along the way, but this is the kind of film that will warrant many repeated viewings for the kid inside of you (if you happen to be of the more mature age). The casting is brilliant (especially with the Arrested Development connection). The whole Joker/Batman relationship thing is brilliant. And did I mention the inside jokes? Plan to spend a bit of time researching the film after you see it, as picking out all of things you missed is half the fun. But the half that does stick? Let's just say the first 45 minutes of the film alone gives you enough to play back for weeks and weeks and weeks and still be just as funny. The story might sit in the background a bit, but don't mistake this movie for failing to have a heart. The scene where Batman puts the new picture on the wall near the end hits just the right emotional note, and while the essential joke (of walking us through every nook and cranny of the Batman universe) does back off a bit in the second half, this is where the story gets a chance to breathe. And how about those villains (all real by the way). And further along in the film it expands not only into Superman territory, but a "there are no boundaries for who to include" territory. And it is rather wonderful. Another home run for The Lego Movie franchise.
 Matt A 	  As with The Lego Movie, this starts off very fast with the jokes and witty one liners so you definitely need to be on your toes with picking up on them. If you know your Batman lore and are up to date with the films then you will be laughing out loud to pretty much everything. Will Arnett is on fine form as Batman, in fact all of the cast are really good. The animation is as you would expect, detailed and exquisite. My only complaint is that it felt a little too long and dragged near the end, but it doesn't stop it from being such good fun. It may not be to young kids tastes, as there were some young ones around 3-6 that were getting agitated in the screening that we were in. Still a fantastic film that you will love if you loved The Lego Movie :-)
 Max S 	  I went in without seeing any trailers and just the knowledge of how well the first LEGO movie did, and LEGO Batman was a very fun watch! It captures everything I would imagine a LEGO movie being: imaginative, creative, clever, and cute. Tapping into Batman's history, the movie creates a beautiful little world where both adults and kids can go on an entirely unique adventure that is well worth the price of admission.
 Bill T 	  This was fine.. but very overwhelming! The depth of characters and art direction and jokes are all at a fever pitch here. So much so it all becomes a blur. So much so, that plots and conclusions are usually over and done with too fast for us to even care. Which is my biggest complaint about this one. Still, dazzing, and has the weirdest usage of Michael Jackson's "Man In The Mirror" ever.
 Ted S 	  I LOVED this movie. I loved its innocence, its humor, and the love the makers of it had for the film. With Batman movies getting darker and darker they are leaving me behind but this one welcomed me back to the character. See this movie!
 Callan G 	  How is the lego batman movie the best batman movie ever made? I dunno but it is!
 Josh C 	  The Lego Batman Movie is a fun ride with tons of cameo moments that will make the kid in you . It's energetic and incredibly animated, with witty humor and a sentiment that serves the movie well. Plus, it's Lego and it's Batman. What's there not to like?
 Brian S 	  Great movie, very funny and full of great puns and references if youre a fan of past batman movies or batman in general. Only suffers from being a sequel and feeling like it copies the original Lego Movie in some unnecessary ways. Overall great movie!
 Edil O 	  This movie has the best Batman song I have ever heard. It's definitely a MUST SEE if you are a fan of "The Batman" and all his lore.
 Valeria Z 	  bien hecha para nios, pero aburrida.
 Bryce P 	  Awesome, hilarious movie!
 Jared R 	  I see why this was reviewed so highly. As a true batfan I loved every joke and jab at the dark Knight and the universe and history he inhabits. Not to mention the impressive voice casting they is becoming a staple of Lego movies. will own
 Joe S 	  as die hard batman fan I loved it was funny had a sense of humor and it shows a lot of history of the famous character I love !!! the kids will love because they'll be wanting to buy the toys after watching this !! it's not as good as the first movie of this series the Lego movie but it is funny !!
 Davis W 	  Great movie, especially on Valentine's Day; also very topical
 Finn S 	  Good but not as funny as i wanted, it was more sad than i wanted
 Zaki M 	  Chaotic, funny at parts. Most of the movie we see Batman being the Batman we see on the Internet "Coz I'm Batman" meme's and etc. Robin's 'daddy' obsession is cringy. Funny cameos and references. Overall an okay and fun film but never amazing or great.
 JV T 	  This new Lego spin-off is a real tribute to all things Batman! The movie's visual overload and 100 jokes per second (especially in the first act which is a hilarious nod to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series) is dizzying at first but makes repeat viewings a visual treat. Will Arnett makes for an awesome campy Batman that stands heads and shoulders (figuratively speaking) with Adam West's version. The rest of the voice talents are best at playing off Arnett. Part of the fun of these Lego flicks are all the unexpected cameos that show up especially since these could never really happen in a live-action version. The dialogue is all very tongue-in-cheek that will appeal to a young audience while older fans will laugh at all the innuendos. Compared to The Lego Movie though, the emotional message is not as resonant but the fun factor compensates for that.
 Spencer P 	  In an ultra-surprising move, The Lego Batman Movie keeps on its dazzlingly rendered, frequently funny, and occasionally sobering, romp through the LEGO universe in what may be the best Batman movie ever - one that's self-aware of how the whole dang thing is more stupid than anything.
 Alora T 	  An amazing movie. So cute and funny. Will definitely buy when it comes out. Favorite Batman movie, hands down. Batman the Animater Series will always be my favorite adaptation. But this movie really was great. I hope this movies success means we get more Lego movies in the future.
 Devin D 	  Funny, good story, good message, not as good as the Lego Movie, but still good for all ages.
 Colton D 	  Hilarious and often times touching, this batman parody is beautifully animated, even if it's slightly unstructured.
 Austin M 	  4.5 stars because...I haven't laughed this much from a kid's movie in God knows how long. This movie was highly entertaining from the beginning to the end. My only complaint is that the ending definitely seemed to drag on a bit too long, with the rest of the film being so fast paced. But this movie is still hilarious.
 Justin B 	  Though it falls short of The Lego Movie's meta brilliance, this spinoff sequel shockingly succeeds at being a both a sturdy follow up and a legitimately good batman movie.
 Mike P 	  What's the password? IRONMAN SUCKS!
 Ben G 	  one of the best Batman movies ever. absolutely hilarious!!
 Paul D 	  While this did have a fair share of enjoyable moments, it somehow didn't leave me as entertained as the original Lego Movie did. This is still a movie that I am sure the kids will love. My main gripe with this movie is the villains that appear in it. They took me completely out of the movie, which I thought was great up until that point.
 Ayrton Anthony C 	  Puntaje Original: 6.5Divertida e ideal para ver en familia. The Lego Batman Movie nos ofrece una entretenida historia, que aunque hecha para chicos, tambin puede embelesar momentos hilarantes como cualquier otra ficcin del caballero oscuro.
 Daniel Y 	  The Lego Batman movie is a hilariously good time that people of all ages will enjoy, especially if you're a fan of the caped crusader and have a lot of knowledge about his funnier past. However, if you are the type of person that doesn't like references or the first lego movie, then you'll be easily annoyed by it. Also, this film isn't as perfect as its predecessor. At times it can tell a visual joke thats suppose to poke fun at corny moments in movies, but just comes off as a corny joke about a coeny subject and this movies plot is almost exactly the same as The Lego Movie's but it still works, so I can't complain too much.
 Izac V 	  A very fun, fast and funny take on Batman that I enjoyed as an adult. Kids should love it with the frenetic action and all of the lovable characters.
 Tiny T 	  What LEGO Batman manages to do is actually quite impressive. It's simultaneously both a perfect skewering of Batman's 60+ years in pop culture, and a loving celebration of it. Don't miss this one if you're a Bat-fan or if you're sick to death of him.
 Brian B 	  The Lego Batman Movie is fucking spectacular and mind blowing, Batman was spectacular, Robin was spectacular, Alfred was spectacular, Barbara Gordon was spectacular, The Joker was spectacular better than Jared Leto Joker, Harley Quinn was good, the rest of the characters were spectacular, the first act was spectacular and Mind blowing, the third act was fucking spectacular and mind blowing, the visuals were spectacular, the score was spectacular, second favorite Batman movie of all time
 Jeremy G 	  Batman was the best character. Most relatable Batman to-date.
 trey s 	  Funny, enjoyable, and good for all ages. I would recommend it fully.
 Joey R 	  A bit boring in some spots but still a decent movie. The most decent DC movie since The Dark Knight!!
 Dave R 	  It was cute funny action packed had heart and Lego of course the hole movie was pretty good just as good as the Lego Movie. I enjoyed it its a good family movie at the same time as well.
 Matthew H 	  The Lego Batman Movie was not as funny as I had expected it to be. Another example of when all the best scenes are in the previews.
 Edgar R 	  the dark knight of Lego movies.
 Caleb M 	  A disappointment, to say the least. Started out strong but then forgot the original parody that it was going for. Instead of brilliant satire, constant digs at any and all other Batman films, and the great one-liners that only Arnett could pull off, the movie decided to take itself too seriously and turn into something it shouldn't have become. While the first thirty minutes were quipy, interesting, and funny, the rest of this movie was a sad representation of Batman. All the fresh reviews of Lego Batman must be about the animation solely, as the rest of the movie was a flop and deserves to find its way out of the theater quickly!It is unfortunate as I was was truly looking forward to this movie and thought it had every potential element to be a good one. Sadly, WB has lost any of its production prowess since its animated shows and needs to just let the movies go to Bad Robot or someone.
 Steve T 	  When I herd it takes a village in the third act, not a batman....eye-roll- guess it was not for me
 Jacob M 	  The Lego Batman Movie ReviewHoly Shit Batman what a breathe fresh air like finally a Really good DC Movie and a Batman movie. Will Arnet is fantastic as BatmanMichael Cera steals it as RobinRalph Fienes is a great AlfredRosario Dawson was a great Barbra Gordon Zach Galfanakis was a Joker especially when he just wants Batman to tell him he Hates himHe was better than Jared Leto Its one Consistent Tone unlike Cough the shitty DCEU CoughThe Opening scene is amazing The Cameos were Fucking awesome even though there's someone in the movie where a villain is voice by someone one before not in this one lol.The Animation is beautifulThe Music and Score is fantasticThe Scene where it makes fun of all the Batman movies Makes fun of the DCEU and Suicide Squad and stupid Suicide Squad is. (Same studio by the way)Channing Tatum as Superman is amazing really hope he gets his own movie. Overall: I really love this movie more than the Lego Movie it was fun and hilarious and again breathe of fresh air of how Depressing as shit BvS was and how Shit Suicide Squad is WB needed a win and it got one. Overall Grade: A+
 Jamie T 	  Had so much fun! I'm glad this movie redeemed Batman's status as the infamous caped-crusader we all love.
 Ercides R 	  Divertido e cheio de citaes de outros filmes.
 Hammy 0 	  OMG 91% - I say more like 15% this movie sucked big time, I fell asleep, it never ended, and the jokes are stupid. "SPOILER ALERT" - The worse part was when Batman was in his underwear, and falling in love with the commissioners daughter. I did not like any part of the movie, the plot was boring. I wouldn't watch this ever again, I'm surprised I survived this.
 Ben V 	  Trailer looked really great and fun! but maybe my expectations where really high! Some funny moments but very few in between, was too long anyway with not alot going on, wasn't boring done the job, but could/should of been better!
 Axl S 	  I really enjoyed the movie! I think if you are going to try and make BATMAN funny, you should do it right. They did a fantastic job!
 Johnson C 	  A clever parody to our favorite black caped crusader. Brilliant use of characters from both the Batman and Lego universes to create a hilarious masterpiece.
 Diego H 	  What a Blaaaaast! The Lego Batman movie is the Dc/Wb that we need
 Scott M 	  daft as fook which makes it really funny at times. enjoyed it and prob laughed at it more than the kids did. would say looks like a kids movie but plenty adult references that would go right over a kids head. cool also seeing various evil villian sorts all together in lego form not just from the usual batman films or progs.
 William G 	  Another great Lego movie. Action, adventure comedy, drama, even some romance. Overall excellent movie. I did have one small gripe and it had to do with the main plot but the movie flowed real good and the voice acting was right on. One thing you need to watch out for is the password to the batch email, it will have you bawling in your seat! A solid 4.5 stars out of 5.
 Ro M 	  The movie opens with the Joker plotting a caper intended to bring the city to its knees and cement his place as Batman's GREATEST FOE. But at the height of the action, Batman balks at the Joker's every attempt to "ship" them. The whole setup plays to the (barely) unspoken codependent relationship between Batman and Joker to sidesplitting effect. Batman then, once again, saves the city and takes his victory lap (really there's just no way to describe all the hilarity). LEGO Batman will absolutely turn out to be the relationship goals movie for more than one dude-bro among us and we who have to live them can't but be hilariously amuse at the irony.Alongside this amusingly beleaguered bromance, Batman sees Barbara Gordon Barbara's the ass-kicking, four-point plan having cop Gotham needs to wean itself off its dependence on Batman's vigilante ways. As these two are at loggerheads, here comes the Joker - again - with a brilliant plan to make the Batman see just how much he really needs him... cue shenanigans, mad cap, beyond reasonable shenanigans.If you thought the scenes from the commercial with Robin (Michael Cera) were hilarious you're going to be reduced to tears before the end of the movie.LEGO Batman is the perfect follow up to the LEGO Movie. It brings the tongue-in-cheek vibe of the first movie to LEGO Gotham. With a hat tip to the first installment Batman's skills as a master builder are all kinds of on display. The jokes are plentiful, the side-eye at the various incarnations of the caped crusader and his arch-nemesis a bound and the cameos are ridiculous (just ask your "nerd friends").Batman, voiced with Will Arnet's dry-witted and comical delivery, pulls the audience in to this story in a way I only wish the DCU would get it's sh*t together enough to give us in with its most recent live-version; funny what effectively drawing on every last property featuring Batman owned by the studio can do for a script.It doesn't really matter what decade you grew up, every last one has an incarnation of Batman and the makers of LEGO Batman know it, love it and embraced it with their entire snark-driven hearts. This is an easter-egg riddled, double entendre delivering, laugh out loud good time.You walk out with a smile on your face and more than one quotable quotes to work into conversation. Side-note: I want a Lego Justice League movie immediately - trust me you will too.
 Walter V 	  It is the best Batman movie done. Fun, action, story, all in one movie!
 Alton S 	  The story is a bit boring
 Brevin S 	  *Spoiler alert*The Lego Batman movie is a whole lot of fun to watch. The world that was created her is creative and imaginative and the writers on this project truly understand the Batman character and all of his different dimensions. There is also plenty of Easter eggs all throughout this movie too. If your a Batman fan you will enjoy this film.One of my favorite aspects of this movies is the way everything looks. No it not as good looking as Lego Movie was, but it still feels like that world and it is defiantly a world I feel like playing in. It is just sooo much fun to be in this world. Every thing that was built is amazing and just a whole lot of fun to see it all come to life.I also loved the idea of family that was threaded throughout this movie. I have always been a fan of the Batfmaily in DC Comics. It is in my opinion the best part of the Batman mythos. I have always loved Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon and the rest of the family. And this movie understands why there such a big part of the Batman mythos and a needed part of the rest of the movie.I also loved seeing the rest of the Justice League in this film tooo. Though I do wish they had larger roles.And there is a issue I have with this film. You have the Justice League in this world and yet there never used when the action comes up. All of Gotham is about to be destroyed and there was no Superman or Green Lantern anywhere. It was like the movie forgot they were in this universe. and instead we get all these WB knockoffs like Voldermort and Godzilla. It was just so bad.There is also a part of the movie that plays like every other action film ever and it drags the story out for longer than needed. I hated it. I also don't like this Barbara Gordon and Batman relationship that DC keeps pushing. Throw that bull out of here and keep it locked up if your not Bruce Timm. That is not there relationship!!!Overall though there is still a lot to like about this film and I really had fun with it.
 Ethan A 	  This crazy, laugh a minute thrill ride is just as frenetic as the first Lego Movie, and just as charming.

 Noah A 	  It was nice, funny, and full of energy. C+
 Johnny B 	  This was a fantastic movie that audiences of all ages can enjoy. There is non-stop action and laughs for the kids, as well as genuinely well-thought-out jokes and references for the adults. You're kids will love it and so will your inner child.
 Rosie P 	  Absolutely loved this movie, perhaps one of the best animated films I've seen in a really long time. An absolute perfect parody of the Dark Knight and the world he inhabits.
 Zarley Z 	  There were funny moments. There were moments so stupid or awkward that they got a laugh. But mostly it was out of touch, trying so hard that it was at many points impossible to enjoy.
 Karen A 	  Great fun for all ages, my 7 year old daughter found it especially funny, I've never heard her laugh so loud at the cinema. Some great characters from classic 80s movies too
 Matthew I 	  Meh. Can we say "Jumping the Shark"?? Didn't think it could be done with just one movie/episode, but here we are. Way too much packed in for kids to follow. And multiple big bosses from other franchises? It's like Batman is basically a God and there is literally nothing he can't fix except himself. Ugh. Redbox it.
 Nicholas D 	  funny adult humor but still suitable for children. Suggested for Batman fans old or young.
 St John P 	  This is the Batman parody we need. Daleks and Voldemort in the same movie? Hell yeah! And was that a Frank Miller mutant from Dark Knight Returns?
 Daniel W 	  Best Batman movie in a long time!
 Samuel N 	  Fun family movie with cool action and characters might buy
 Matthew L 	  Lego Batman in and of itself was a good Batman movie. It wasn't just a Batman origin story and it did not take itself seriously at all. It catered to all generations of Batman fans and even through in a clip of the original Batman TV show. Overall it was fun with a ton of cheap laughs. If you're expecting a blockbuster or an Oscar winner (why would you), then turn away now. If you're looking for a fun time for you and/or your kids then you won't be disappointed.
 Richard B 	  Bats**t CrazyPeople loved the Lego Movie for its art and heart, but this sequel strains every sinew to be as charming and funny. Sometimes it succeeds on its on own terms, but does not have the depth of characters, or the subject matter to wholly win the game. It is, after all, a Batman movie by any other name, and a toy commercial to boot.The story is similar to TLM - the discovery of humanity - this time in Batman (last time it was the dad). This is yet another case of misandry - the joke of all Batman movies is that he is testosterone crazed maniac - who needs to be cured/trained/ relieved by a woman. This film - in Lego, mind you - is no exception. Of course, this is all both right out front - and hidden. That's what makes it work, and what makes it not work that well. Not only has the Batman to engage with his 'son' Robin, Barbara Gordon (the new police commissioner of course) and Alfred - he has to bond with him. He even needs to embrace his nemesis, the joker in a gushy man-hugging way, admits is important to him.But the film still dazzles, it's pretty funny (but not as funny as it thinks, or as TLM). Us men are such damaged, inadequate pr**ks, right? We need fixing and we know that. Our kids will know it too, because every damn piece of entertainment I've seen has this theme in the subtext at least.Still good fun.
 Kevin C 	  Movie morning with Gertie.When the original Lego movie came out, it was a refreshing pick me-up with Pixar in the doldrums. Animation had a strong 2016, so this didn't pack quite the same punch. It is funny, but 20 mins too long; and the best gags are all in the trailers.
 Gabriel C 	  Ao assistir eu me senti no paraso. Vale muito a pena principalmente se alguns desses pontos a seguir lhe chamar ateno. Ele  recheado de referncias e homenagens ao "universo Warner" Ex: harry potter, super gmeos,Dc comics, Gremlis, Jurassic Park... isso s pra citar alguns. O filme em si  muito divertido, e somando com a nostalgia temos uma experincia incrvel! Curiosidades: 1 A sesso na qual eu estava os adultos se divertiram muito mais, acredito que  pelo fato das crianas no terem conseguido entender 90% das referncias.2  muito interessante como o filme explora o relacionamento do Batman com Coringa e o Dick ( primeiro Robin)
 Bob R 	  Very funny and a great time for the family!
 Jerry L 	  My favorite batman film by far, so much fun. dozens of obscure characters, great emotional story, rapping will arrnett, and the bat family
 Mariko M 	  Funny and fast paced action for the whole family. Wish the DC cinematic universe had good movies as Warner Animation Group
 Emil E 	  Surprisingly Awesome :D
 Nicholas B 	  Everything is Batman and everything is awesome!  As a big fan of Batman and The Lego Movie, I have been super excited for this film since it was announced. But as ever with something like this, I have been worried that it might not live up to my expectations. Fortunately, about five seconds in, all of my fears were laid to rest. Director Chris McKay brilliantly explores the endless possibilities of Lego. It is a beautiful roast but also love letter and tribute to the character and films of Batman. The level of detail and attention paid to the characters and also the Lego world is second to none and there are some great callbacks to The Lego Movie. There is naturally a lot of fan service and the film is jam packed with references and jokes about the previous Batman movies but there is enough humour, action and cameos from other franchises and Lego properties to keep younger children and non-Batman-fans entertained. The animation in The Lego Movie was brilliant and it has been improved upon here, the cinematography is gorgeous and the soundtrack is superb, taking motifs from classic Batman movies but I also felt a hint of Mad Max Fury Road in there! And that opening number was insane!! Will Arnett was one of the best things about The Lego Movie and he transitions effortlessly to his own feature. Michael Cera is wonderful as Robin and injects even more humour into the film with his innocent mind. Ralph Fiennes wonderfully channels his Monsieur Gustav from The Grand Budapest Hotel as Alfred Pennyworth and Rosario Dawson is a good Batgirl. Zack Galifianakis is a brilliant Joker and is clearly - much like the rest of the cast - having an absolute blast playing these wonderful characters. Also, Lego Joker > Jared Leto Joker. If I have any criticisms it's that the beginning of the third act does take a change of pace which feels somewhat out of place with the rest of the film but it does soon pick up. Also, there is so much going on I feel like I'm missing lots, but if that means I can watch this again and again and still take new things from it then that is fine by me!I sat through this film with a smile on my face from its fourth-wall-breaking-beginning to its fourth-wall-breaking-end. The Lego Movie was great but The Lego Batman Movie is absolutely fantastic. They both however take places among my favourite animated movies. I can't wait to see The Lego Ninjago Movie but let's get a sequel to this very soon, yes?4.5/5
 Britain B 	  Fasted-paced, hilarious & totally meta, 'The Lego BATMAN Movie' is a worthy addition to the BATMAN cannon.
 Houston C 	  EXTREMELY clever humor, some of which consists of several layers of wittiness that warrants several rewatches. Gorgeous animation, great voices - the only problem here is the narrative flow. It's really pretty poor. That said, it's still a hilarious and fun movie.
 Sebastian P 	  Una excelente pelcula. Tal vez el director de esta pelcula debe de reemplazar a Zack Snyder.
 Skye C 	  actually better than I thought it would be...
 faisal s 	  A fun Lego movie, with many sarcastic jokes on the DC universe, so if you are a of comics fan, you would definitely get it. During the trailer, I found Robin damn annoying but he did great in the movie.
 Dennis J 	  The movie starts with a bang, falls flat in the middle, and ends on a high note.
 Ronnie C 	  its a cute story. Just not a normal Batman movie.
 Carlos H 	  Just the best fan service of Batman ever, hilarious!
 Vincent S 	  Funny, hilarious, entertaining. It's pretty good Lego animation movie, and also one of the best "Batman" films(at least better than last year "Batman v Superman", which is pretty poor and totally disappointed).It's definitely suitable for all kids, younger and older, boys and girls, everyone!
 Peter P 	  if you enjoyed the Lego Movie you will have a blast! Batman is hilarious. This movie has a lot of heart and a lot of Lego city crushing action.Clever plot line and cameos by dozens of DC heroes and villains make this a winner for kids and parents.
 tyler n 	  Who thought lego could make a great batman movie!!! Loved all the references, the jokes were rapid fire!! I was laughing almost the entire time!!
 Aaron V 	  As some would know, I love DC Comics. One of my favorite heroes is Batman. I've seen most of the Batman films. The only two I haven't seen is Batman Forever and Batman Begins. So when I heard that a Lego Batman movie was in the making, I was thinking that this was just a rumor, before the 2 trailers appeared on YouTube. Aside form that, this movie is pretty great. It makes fun of all the Batman clichs in a good way. The cast does a pretty great job and the film is also jam-packed with Easter Eggs. The only part I didn't enjoy in the film was the ending. I won't spoil anything. I thought the ending was pretty rushed. i was thinking that a great way to end the movie would've been to have the Justice League help Batman defeat the Joker. But they are barely in the film. But for what this film is worth is really fun. I think Families and DC fans alike will enjoy this film and I will be purchasing this film on Blue ray.
 Greg D 	  Continuing the delightfully joyous tone that the first Lego Movie set, The Lego Batman Movie thrives all on its own
 Kathy D 	  Great movie ; all about family on family day ??
 Adam F 	  Como descrever um filme cujo o objetivo e lhe fazer rir e ele j consegue fazer isso antes da primeira cena surgir, e continua fazendo por praticamente o longa inteiro. Lego Batman  simplesmente fantstico, muito divertido, engraado e frentico. O deleite definitivo para os fs do Batman, sinceramente se voc gosta do Batman voc DEVE ir assistir esse filme, e olha que eu nem sou to f assim, uma homagem a Warner Bros e uma deliciosa salada de frutas para os fs de filmes. Vale muito a pena ir assistir.
 Liam M 	  9.0/10The LEGO Batman Movie is a perfect example that spoof films can make a resurgence if they are as goofy, self referential, and love their source material as much as this film does.
 Johnny W 	  A enjoyable romp and fun! Will Arnett has joined the short list of actors that done The Dark Knight legend justice and has fun doing it also. Zach Galifianakis is awesome as The Joker!
 C.J. H 	  The Lego Batman Movie is an entertaining flick that is jammed packed with references and easter eggs that will no doubt keep even the most jaded people chuckling. The movie ultimately feels like an extended episode of Robot Chicken or something along those lines though, for better or for worse.
 Linda W 	  Very disappointed...not nearly as well done as the original Lego movie.
 Dean J 	  I don't break things down. All I can tell you is I laughed a lot and loud. I may see it again.
 Matthew Y 	  KILL.....ME......PLEASE!!!!! "The Lego Batman Movie" seems like a fun idea......UNTIL YOU SEE IT!! I miss when the "Batman" movies were amazing. Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as The Joker. Those were the best cast and characters. However, Heath Ledger was the best Joker ever. My point is this movie made no sense and was not the slightest bit fun. Will Arnet's voice may be entertaining as Batman but he can't bring the DC Comics character to life. DO NOT SEE THIS TRASH!!!
 Markoz M 	  if you like the last lego movie yo are going to love this movie
 Ryan J 	  A bright, colourful and super sharp spin-off to the Lego Movie, this time managing to cleverly lampoon the superhero coventions and Batman persona. A great cast and full of wild imagination, the plot doesn't function as well as the much smarter original, but this is still very entertaining nonetheless. 7.0/10.
 Chris V 	  Poor. I was bored and felt like I'd already seen all the funny bits. They were in the trailer.
 Mark D 	  I wish I was a critic so I could downgrade that garbo 91%. Movie was full of the typical shrek-like adult humor that get's disguised for the kiddos. Still boring. I feel asleep at the theater. Mediocre. Should be a 70%er
 Daniel A 	  Really not my kind of movie .. kinda dull
 Jake H 	  an absolute masterpiece
 jeff c 	  follow me on Instagram@garrison_2003
 Brad S 	  My son liked it and I laughed throughout most of the movie with the jokes they were telling and throw backs to older movies
 Nick S 	  Fun, touching, but slow paced in the middle.
 Savannah B 	  Lots of humor, but got a bit long and sappy through the second half.
 Matt C 	  Three years ago, I thought that The LEGO Movie would be a cynically minded, cacophonous disaster. When I saw it (three times in theaters) upon release, I was delighted to discover the way in which the movie used and subverted expectations, making it one of the best movies of 2014. The LEGO Batman Movie had me understandably excited, and I mostly go what I wanted and expected. The sarcastic humor, bevy of pop culture references, and quick humor demonstrates a generally spiritual connection between the original and this spin-off. It isn't great, though, mostly because it lacks the depth of the original's story, character, and metatextual humor--this installment is more icing than cake. Nonetheless, it's a funny and fun diversion. Bruce Wayne/Batman (again voiced by Will Arnett) lives his life of luxury and self-imposed emotional and physical isolation, spouting out sarcastic jabs when he is or isn't fighting Gotham's villains. When The Joker (Zach Galifianakis) expresses disappointment in his and Batman's lackluster relationship and Batman's desire to "fight around" instead of only hate The Joker, The Joker decides to make all villains surrender with him in order to make Batman bored and jealous. Meanwhile, Batman has to deal with Dick Grayson/Robin (Michael Cera), who he's accidentally adopted during an absent-minded bout of word vomit. As mentioned, this is the type of humor that you'd expect from this now-franchise. References the previous incarnations of the character abound and the movie doesn't pull many punches when it comes to making the protagonist a selfish prick--otherwise it would feel like a cheat. The movie is well timed aside from being too fast, trying to replicate the pace that Phil Lord and Chris Miller perfected with the first movie along with the Jump Street films. They only serve as producers here, with Chris McKay of Robot Chicken helming this one. That comes across, since this is a lot like a Robot Chicken movie, albeit more focused and not annoying. The LEGO Batman Movie succeeds in being a comedy given the amount of laughs that it elicits, either from subversions of expectations or the anarchic nature of it all, and the voice actors are very much in tune with their characters. Where the movie falls short is in regards to its storytelling and consistency of execution. Whereas the first movie was a story about stories and fully self-referential with a point that was crucial to the film, this rattles off references without using them or their respective tropes as thoroughly. It may be an odd comparison, but if The LEGO Movie was Scream, The LEGO Batman Movie is Scream 3. The humor wasn't just funny in the first one; it was the crux of the movie and its scope. This movie also is more hyperactive than the first, which immediately puts it in dangerous territory given how careful the joke delivery and pacing was. This doesn't have as much breathing room and feels like too much of a sugar rush at times. There's also a little less attention to detail, not having the tactile nature to the animation of the first, like oily fingerprints on the pieces or the clarity of animation--the shift in the creative team is noticeable throughout. Again, this movie marks another success for what would have previously been thought of being nothing more than a horrific cash-grab. It's fast and funny with fitting voice work and a multiple laugh-out-loud moments. The bluntness to the humor and pop culture references are well tuned and the bizarre nature of some of the jokes make for an entertaining experience. This isn't a movie that I'll see again and it does feel like a missed opportunity, but on its own terms, The LEGO Batman Movie works well enough. 6.8/10, decent, B-, (barely) above average, etc.
 Thomas S 	  Great, funny and creative movie. A must-see lego movie.
 Seth S 	  A sequel/spinoff that actually manages to deliver as much emotional heft as its predecessor.
 Greg G 	  This movie is the ultimate homage to Batman and the DC universe as a whole. Both funny and introspective it achieves greatness.
 Rikki B 	  While the movie is certainly enjoyable to watch, full of laughs and gorgeous animation, the story's emotional arc failed to resonate with me in the way that its predecessor's did. Which doesn't mean that this was a bad movie by any means, just that it's not something I'm going to want to watch again and again. If you have kids or love Batman, this will probably be a fun watch for you, just don't go in expecting anything amazing.
 Tim B 	  Everything is NOT awesome. Half the movie goes against the Lego Logic of the first movie, featuring real human films and music in a Lego universe that only satirizes human things in a Lego form in the previous film. Also, so many references to previous Batman films and psychoanalysis of Batman that would not be of any interest to the target audience of children.
 Angel M 	  Graciosa, entretenida.
 Jeff S 	  Holly lego matman legos knows matman!
 Filippo V 	  Alcune scene sono simpatiche, altre sono molto infantili e nonostante la grande variet di personaggi e autoironia, questo nuovo film dei Lego per me sfiora a pelo la sufficienza.
 Alyan H 	  a laugh a minute riot!!!
 Richard G 	  ok so "THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE" is one of the better Batman movies paying it's respects to all Batman flicks before it...it's funny but not as funny as it thinks it is... Voiced by Will Arnett, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson and Ralph Fiennes... they do a great job recreating and expanding on the Familiar characters ...the weak link and what brought the movie down for me was Zach Galifianakis as the Joker...the most unjoker like Joker ever...he just provides a voice..there is no crazy in any of the voice...it made me sad....Mark Hamill where are you? if you are a long time Batman fan go see it in the Dark with Strangers otherwise wait for it and watch it on the couch with a pal....
 Jonathan K 	  Great movie! Loved Batman, and loved the look at his loner image and why he is that way. Wish they would have done more with his actual villains. I was super excited to hear Billy D was going to play Two Face, but he only had like two lines of dialogue... oh, wait, I literally did not get that until I just wrote it. Very clever. Anyway, great flick. Never thought I would get to see Batman fight Gremlins, but I was wrong!
 Steven P 	  Poking fun at 78 years of comic mythology and its many previous film adaptations, The Lego Batman Movie is a fantastic family film as well as a sleek animated thriller that "builds" on the successes of the surprise hit of the original Lego movie. With the potential for more spinoff films in the future, it's the ideal alternate reality for these times and proves that it's great to be Batman!
 Moe M 	  Spoiler alert right off the back.Overall the movie was good, but they edited a lot of scenes that were in the initial previews from the movie. I kind of expected more of the justice league in action with batman, but that didn't happen. Wasn't to impressed with the music. They didn't play the theme song that was in the previews, so that was a let down. The enemy's that were in the phantom zone couldn't have been more ridiculous. Putting the wizard of oz witch in their was unnecessary as well as that other stupid magic villain. Aside from that, I though it was hilarious. Batman is so full of himself it's funny. He did learn humility though.Good movie overall.
 Sean M 	  This movie is a laugh riot and cleverly juggles all things LEGO and Batman, and while it runs a little long it's certainly worth watching.
 Barry N 	  I had a lot of fun. The movie was packed with jokes about past movies and the 60s television show. I loved the updated Batman theme. I will definitely see this again.
 GH R 	  Very solid, fun, imaginative. Not as good as Lego Movie.
 Private U 	  not as good as the first one
 William L 	  good story very funny
 Jovi J 	  the slapstick satirical comedy is funny buy at times repetitive and too much. Still a pretty nice feel good movie but I don't think it deserves the 90%/90% rating on rotten tomatoes. :)
 Rafael S 	  Wonderful movie, hope it will have a 2.
 Eduardo S 	  If you compare LEGO Batman Movie with the original LEGO Movie, it falls a bit. But comparing to, lets say Batman vs Superman, then is a masterpiece. Forget the legos, this is (crazy stuff apart) a truly great addition to the Batman movie repertoire.
 Adam T 	  Chris McKay's 'The Lego Batman Movie' (2017) provides a strong superhero satire, but also a great Batman film. Will Arnett reprises his role from 'The Lego Movie' (2014) and absolutely kills it, giving a performance that's equally funny, yet also pure to the mythos of the Batman character. Minor criticisms, the film doesn't have the emotional heft that 'The Lego Movie' even though the story had a similar climax. Overall though, 'The Lego Batman Movie' is a fun time.
 Tim C 	  One of the funniest movies in a long time. My son and I laughed for 90 minutes straight, so much so that my sides hurt. Really funny and if you need an escape, go see it. We saw it in IMAX, which made it even better.
 Javi S 	  Funny, funny...funny
 Geoff L 	  Way overhyped and not very funny. The writers try to hard to make Batman vulnerable.
 Aaron M 	  The director and writers made a great comic book movie that takes on comic books. There were some great nods to the previous versions of Batman along with the comic book industry as a whole. I found this movie more enjoyable than The Lego Movie and I loved The Lego Movie.
 Max E 	  Kind of sad that Lego Batman was better than Suicide Squad and BvS combined.
 Andrea M 	  Lego seems to have their movie formula figured out. The jokes fly with Veep wit and speed. If you laugh too loud you might not catch the next one. Loved the callback to the Master Builder concept. It's a nice subtle reminder to the universe they've set up. I enjoyed this movie from the cynical self aware, self narrated, black screen beginning to the K Pop "Friends Are Family" number.
 Edward G 	  Bright, silly and non-stop fun from start to finish, The Lego Batman Movie is another home-run in what's turning out to be a surprisingly successful franchise for Warner Bros. I'm sure they'd like to say the same about the other one...
 Kevin P 	  Such a fun movie for the whole family! I've never seen more fun references packed into one movie. Complete with shark repellent.
 Diane V 	  It was just okay. I loved the first Lego movie.
 Steve R 	  Most of the funny bits were in the trailer. Lego movie was much better.
 soumik d 	  After the dark knight i see a best dark knight animated movie in my life.i helluva want to see this movie.
 Andrew K 	  While not as fresh and consistent as the Lego Movie from a couple years ago, there are reasons to give Lego Batman a chance. The first half is chalk full of witty dialogues and hilarious homages to the caped crusader's...colorful lore. This iteration's take on certain characters and their relationships with others is novel and naturally, the animation and actors get the job done.
 Sheetal B 	  It was an OK movie. Nothing great. Some dialogues seemed forced.
 Cuneyt S 	  OMG. I take my children and really didn't think that it was going to be that good but I was wrong way wrong. This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Funny, Great message, Great plot everything that needs to be on a movie was there. Definitely worth it.
