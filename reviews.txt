 Max Y 	  Great movie! Funny at times and suspenseful at others. I love seeing the reviews complaining about how it got its rating from SJWs and blacks. Get over it.
 Perla S 	  Great story line, expected a little more out of this movie, but it was good overall. I would have liked a little more action.
 Andy W 	  Really found this film critically overrated. No way is more than a 3/5 film. The twist was telegraphed from the off and I just found the whole thing to be a standard thriller, no more no less. In its favour the acting was decent and the film had a slight edge to it but to call it a horror film is a bit rich. Bring on the Void!!!
 Morgan M 	  It's not quite as great the opening sequence suggests it could be, but it is my favourite film of 2017 thus far. As clever as but not so stuck-up as anything the Oscars and Golden Globe had to offer.
 Teresa C 	  Scary, creepy, a little bizarre, and funny. Reminds me of The Shining, Twilight Zone, and Key & Peele skits. I loved it. It also has undertones of racial inequality so not everyone will like it.
 Nicholas D 	  Expertly paced and thoughtfully written, director Jordan Peele strikes a near-perfect balance between laugh-out-loud comedy, tastefully violent thrill, and social commentary.
 Jonny B 	  Jordan Peele's directing debut is simply stunning. 'Get Out' is a tremendous exercise in atmosphere and psychological horror with just the right dose of humour. It has you gripped until the very last moment. A masterpiece!
 Simon D 	  Thoroughly original and thrilling, with enough suspense, misdirection and humour to keep you fully engaged until the very last frame!
 Daniel L 	  Difficult to review without spoilers. Know as little as possible to enjoy this the most
 Maggie W 	  Best horror movie I've seen in a long time! Good job Jordon! My hat is off to you!
 Colton D 	  A creepy, yet hilarious horror film that keeps the scares and laughs consistent.
 Kapten V 	  Oh yeah: a horror movie that is actually good. A rare bird, this, no? You could predict the quality - or at least freshness - from the trailers but nothing will quite prepare you for this joyride which is a contender for the best horror movie of recent times, and crafty enough to satisfy also those who don't really care about horror movies. Such as me.Brother (Daniel Kaluuya) dating a white girl (Allison Williams) is dragged to her family estate for the weekend. But something is off from the very start of the journey, and it gets stranger by the minute. There's a variety of cool cats in smaller supporting roles and you will probably not know them by name, but I will list them anyway: Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener as the mother and father, Caleb Landry Jones as the brother, Betty Gabriel as the house maid, LilRel Howery as one of the funniest cases of black guy acting like Hollywood comedy black guy I can remember. IMDb claims he is a rising stand-up comedy star, and he's surely an instant crowd-pleaser here. You will love every precious minute the guy gets to grace the screen.But back to the movie at hand. Get Out" is an effective horror piece but director-screenwriter Jordan Peele's ambitions are decidedly wider than that, and he can meet the high standards that he has set. If I have to to summarize his biggest accomplishment, then I would say that Peele proves to be a master storyteller. There's a surprising diversity and depth to material. It can be followed as social commentary (what it's like to be different; how covertly racist the modern society can be), classic horror story (adventurer braving the lands unknown) and a crafty cat-and-mouse thriller where the joy of watching rises from following how every "chess piece" is moved and how the others react.In addition, there's an unexpected comic relief going on, mainly acted out by LilRey Howrey as mentioned above. And last but not least, the movie makers have really taken their time with the characters and the setting to build an natural, convincing atmosphere which can stand on its own and doesn't have to rely on cheap horror tactics as sudden horrifying noises and movements. Peele actually uses some of those too, but in a way that doesn't feel exploitative; these help to strenghten the oppressive atmosphere and further show how the main character feels.If I may nitpick a little, the central hero deserves to have some more individuality because he mostly gets to react to awkward and/or unpleasant situations like in black version of Curb Your Enthusiasm" or something. This one-note-performance by Kaluuya honestly gets a bit monotone before the action-filled final act.But all in all, the chosen approach is understandable because Get Out" is only 103 minutes long and has a lot happening. And to credit the cast one more time, everybody's offering a top-quality work, even the people in smallest roles. Considering how much their faces are shown up-close, it's no mean feat. I'd even call it one of the most memorable ensemble movies of recent times.There are also some pacing issues, mostly during the end which would be more hard-hitting if played out faster, especially as some major turns are not that hard to figure out by the middle. Of course, that would require attentive watching and not checking your phone all the time, as many youngsters do these days. Also, horror fans would probably like to see more gore but this is not a problem in itself. So the movie's not near perfect but what is, eh?Get Out" is that rare kind of horror movie that really deserves some major-ass awards or nominations. Maybe Oscar noms for original screenplay, directing, and several possible picks from supporting cast (Betty Gabriel, Bradley Whitford, LilRel Howery if I can pick three). If you liked this little gem that deserves to be called born classic, then you will be pleased to know that it's been already popular in cinemas. It only cost 4.5 million USD and has already brought 113 mil from the U.S. box office alone."Get Out" is the best movie of 2017 I've seen yet. And I have seen ten! Get off your ass and run towards the cinemas!
 Raymond C 	  This movie brought to light issues that are happening but rarely discussed. Superb story, and acting!
 Kyrstyn U 	  Best movie I've seen this year. ????
 Wayne T 	  Loved it... not many movies have me yelling at the screen, but this one had the whole theater involved. A perfect blend of tension and humor.
 Grace P 	  I found most of the horror movies disgusting and unpleasant to watch. This one however was an exception. It is hilarious and fascinating. Audience was so into the movie and kept yelling "get out" many times hoping the guy will get out before it is too late. The movie joked about how rich old white people attempt to control and use brilliant black people's bodies and talents but put their consciences in sunken places. The movie also made a white psychiatrist and her neurosurgeon husband look more than horrible. It is a comedy horror movie. Should we take it too seriously?
 Gary C 	  Best horror film I have seen in a long while.
 Bryce P 	  I don't understand how this movie got this rating. Boring, and didn't have much going on. I expected a lot more thrills, and twists.
 Will C 	  This horror comedy succeeds the most in how it uses unabashed, racial stereotypes. A straight-forward original while not entirely predictable.
 Joe L 	  Thought provoking, funny, macabre, scary, twists to the end... Made me think of Vincent Price horror noir movies from the 1950s; with a bit of modern comedic flavor and then the dark evil Vincent Price twist drills into you... loved it!
 Miles M 	  More interesting and more thought-provoking than any genre movie I've seen recently,n
 joseph h 	  A hilarious and scary thrill ride.
 Sean M 	  A great mind freak! Awesome ending!!!
 Wendy F 	  It's a fun, suspenseful, well-done movie. Don't expect too much and you'll have a great time.
 Film C 	  One that I think will require a rewatch. Whilst I felt somewhat disappointed by the conclusion and revelation to the story, it is nevertheless an interesting dark comedy/thriller.
 DyB N 	  Definitely not a 90 satisfaction. It would be an okay matinee movie, or good dvd on the weekend movie. I didn't think it was as good as the hype.
 Mariola F 	  Very bizarre and twisted,but how interesting
 Echo B 	  one of the better movies if seen in a long time.
 Ahsile F 	  new perspective of things
 Chancey P 	  Jordan Peele is a genius. Add this to the list of other great horror movies of late. This might even be the best horror film we'll get for years to come.
 Craig m 	  It's an interesting paranoid idea but it ultimately makes for a fairly weak comedy horror. The laughs aren't that funny and the gore isn't that original. Overrated as most people seem to think it's trendy and are jumping on the bandwagon
 Tats M 	  To all who haven't watched this DO NOT watch the official trailer. Too many plot points revealed. The movie is worth the hype 10/10
 Amanda Nicole Y 	  Greatest movie ever made!!!????????????????????
 David T 	  Watched with my 15 year old daughter tonight. I was watching through my hands?????? been home an hour and my brain is still scrambled with fear. It's a must see film.
 abigail l 	  Finally a horror/comedy movie with a brilliantly thought out plot! This is the best movie I have seen in a long time! I am thoroughly impressed with Peele and the stuff that comes out of his mind.
 Ben V 	  Finally!!!!! A creepy horror thriller! That is well acted, creepy, scary in places, funny, with a very clever plot with twists and turns well done. Thank you!
 Tyler F 	  The movie was way too predictable
 Keven P 	  Dude, watch the movie. It isn't some exorcism movie that goes into the paranormal.. this is like a horror comedy... little details here and there make the movie that much more enjoyable/uncomfortable. If you don't like scary movies, this is the one you SHOULD watch as it is less a "demonic" horror and more a comedic "This is f****** crazy" horror that keeps you engaged the entire time.
 Allen S 	  As I've seen truly classic suspense thrillers like 'Rear Window(Rotten Tomatoes score 100)', 'Se7en(80)', 'The Usual Suspects(88)', 'Signs(74)', 'Memento(92)', 'Silence Of The Lambs(95)', 'Basic Instinct(53)' or 'Fatal Attraction(78)', I am profoundly mystified how THIS low-brow film, with unnecessary racial overtones, could score a 99 on Rotten Tomatoes???? 99?????SPOILER ALERT:It's a banal and entirely unoriginal story of a boyfriend (who's black) meeting his girlfriend's (who's white) white parents. The plot thickens when we discover that the (white) wife hypnotizes all the (white) daughter's (black) boyfriends, and her talented (white) husband, who is SUCH a brilliant (white) surgeon, that he transplants old (white) people's brains into healthy (black) people.pauseThe (black) boyfriend escapes, but not before he kills everyone (white people, and two white geezer brain-controlled black characters) involved.I realize this rated 99 film isn't in the same category as 'Psycho(96)' or 'Dial M For Murder(88)', but trust me....DO NOT SEE THIS AWFUL MOVIE!!!I think this movie could've been so much better without the racially-motivated brain-transplanting????Did I say this movie was awful, yet? You know, the LAST time I saw a brain-transplanting episode of ANYthing was that Gilligan's Island episode where that evil doctor swapped everybody's brains.'Get Out' was basically THAT episode of Gilligan's Island with a dash of 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner(68)'....and 5 minutes of 'What's Happening' and/or 'Dark Shadows'.
 Justus S 	  Jordan Peele hit the jackpot on this one. I haven't seen a film quite like this one. This script itself is fantastic. The plot really pulls you into the film. My interest was captivated from start to finish. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I strongly suggest you to go watch it right now.
 Kristin B 	  This movie was crazy! I would def go and see it again! The story line was well written and the cast complimented each other well. Its a great thriller!
 Mark R 	  After reading the previous reviews I was looking forward to this film. have to say it was very disappointing. The story line was poor. it lacked suspense and was very cliched. would have made a good Dr who storyline but not a film.
 Ming Siu G 	  Peele takes what could've been a B-movie premise from the 50s, updates it in a slick genre exercise, balances it out with some much-needed humour, and - smartest of all - pumps it full of scathing social commentary on race relations. A very solid debut indeed, that bodes well for the future in more ways than one.
 Cassandra P 	  Brilliant acting. Brilliant directing. This movie tackles real social issues with class and wit while being absolutely terrifying. I have always been a fan of thought-provoking movies and horror, but have never seen them so perfectly melded together.
 Anthony J 	  Good horror movie. The plot was very interesting and the ending was soild. The movie was scary without tons of gore which I liked.
 Olivia A 	  Loved this movie. I thought each character was perfect in their role. The story line was interesting and definitely kept me guessing until the end. The way the plot developed really surprised me; I definitely did not see that coming. I loved the way Peele used the comedic relief of the main character's friend in some scenes, it was expertly placed and not annoying like most pieces of comedy in a scary movie can be.Don't miss this one!
 Peter M 	  Best movie I have seen in a long time. Original, great acting, some comic relief, wonderful ending. Everyone in the theater clapped at the end.
 Kelli N 	  Nail biting from beginning to end
 Sharon S 	  Pretty good movie, not long enough, very unusual storyline. Suspense filled, very good cast.
 Matt A 	  A movie very much in the vein of 70s physiological horrors. Beautifully shot, wonderfully scripted and uncomfortably creepy. As close to perfect as any movie in the grenre.
 Paul b 	  IT wasnt a thriller. It was funny in parts that were not meant to be funny. One of the worst movies Ive seen. As bad as Avatar. I saw a few people walk out before it ended. I should have too. The ONLY reason why this is a popular movie is SWJs and blacks love to hate on white people. (you know who you are) If it wasnt for that this movie wouldnt have made more than a few million. This movie was actually marketed to blacks so that tells you the narrative.
 wendy l 	  its was a crear movie ill would but it when it come out in dvd n the moive came out in my bday i saw it on that day with my friends it was lit tho yall should watch it.~????-
 Aaron B 	  Extremely clever and well thought out storyline/plot. The brilliance in Get Out comes from the successful mix of scares, laughs, and most importantly its symbolic and subliminal messages about the development of racial divides. Not sure what scared me more; the movies horror elements or the social injustices it so accurately displays.
 Tony A 	  Best fricken movie I've ever seen
 Bryan C 	  So how exactly do you describe a movie that is part social commentary, part comedy, part thriller, and part horror? Not sure I can -- so I'll just suggest that you go see it.Grade: A+
 Pamela B 	  This movie was awesome I'd go see it again..
 Patrick L 	  Superb, best thriller in recent memory. Congratulations Mr. Peele.
 Fred W 	  It was pretty good! A new type of horror movie for sure. I just didn't leave wanting more. 70% -80% good show.
 Andre M 	  Interesting movie not what you expect
 Andre M 	  Interesting movie not what you expect
 Frank R 	  I want to keep my review of 'Get Out' short and simple because you deserve to experience it, not have me dissect it. It's an instant classic. It's that good. It's that original. Jordan Peele, please, write another movie. Direct another movie. Soon. Thanks, Everyone
 Cynthia%20 T 	  The movie was great. It was eye opening to a lot of things going on in society. The movie also provided relatable persepctives on everyday relationships.
 Jo H 	  Interesting but slow. Parts were a little boring.
 Jarrod J 	  A Cogent, Realistic, Psychological Thriller? Get Out!It has been a long-time running unspoken rule when making horror movie protagonists: the audience must feel superior to the character. This is why we find ourselves often pulling our hair out wondering why someone could be so stupid as to check the basement at midnight, or continue to live in a clearly haunted house when it would be healthier to live in a van down by the river. Writer and director Jordan Peele ignored that rule as he crafts the most organic horror in cinema history.The twisted tale begins innocently as a young, interracial couple Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose (Allison Williams) decide to visit Rose??s parents after having been dating for a few months. Rose??s parents, it turns out, live in a very secluded manor tucked into the woods where everyone??s behaviour seems just a little? off. Is their racial ignorance merely a symptom of living in a heavily predominantly white society, or is it something more sinister?What Peele cleverly manages to do here is put the entire ??horror movie?? concept into perspective. Largely thanks to M. Night Shyamalan, the viewer of any horror movie finds oneself constantly guessing what??s going to happen next. Being a page ahead in the script makes the viewer feel more secure, and less likely to be startled. What happens when a viewer is trying to guess what is going on in this aberrant tale, is that they break down possibilities as such: best-case scenario is that this nice young black man is in the woods with a large group of creepy racists. This is the best-case scenario because it doesn??t involve supernatural-horror influences, just regular-horror influences. Worst-case scenario is left up to the audience's?? imaginations. Now, I won??t divulge here what the situation happened to be (you should go find out for yourself), but the mere fact that a sizable portion of the tension of this horror movie doesn??t come from something out of this world, or a one-in-a-million chance run-in with a psychotic killer, but from a very real and present social issue, this makes the movie feel more real and natural than just about any horror film to date. It??s truly artistic the way they made the audience question the degree of sinisterness of racial tension in general.This organic-feel didn??t stop at incorporating day-to-day threats, though. As previously stated, the sense of superiority to the main character is non-existent for this film, and as such caused the audience to relate to Chris more, bringing them into his experiences. How did Peele accomplish this feat? Simple: good writing. The movie didn??t rely on suspension of belief for the audience to accept Chris?? predicament. Instead, it relied on a carefully constructed storyline that left no holes, and very strong character building, leading the audience to understand that Chris is in a genuine predicament through no fault of his own, and not guilty of hubris like some kids with a video camera looking for a witch in the woods for whatever reason.Get Out still provides other elements found in horror (jump scares, twisting plots, hair-raising music, etc.), added to that extra level of connection, while having a heavy theme of racial isolation and prejudice. By doing so, Peele effectively puts his audience through the fearful and helpless emotions we??re used to while watching horror, but superimposing this over someone feeling desperately culturally victimized. The mix of emotions in this situation causes an audience to truly empathize with the misunderstood character. This is truly art, and Get Out wins. It wins at movie-ing. Go see it because it??s a real thriller. Go see it because of its unique plot. Go see it because of its social discussion. Whichever reason appeals to you, it doesn??t matter. It is a real piece of art you won??t want to miss. You should get out, and go see it.
 John D 	  It's not very often that a film keeps you on the edge of your seat in the ways Get Out did. It's hard to believe Jordan Peele was the mastermind behind this - Key & Peele have their own thing going that works quite well - but, this came out of left field. A creative, effective - we crafted film that is well acted, directed and written.Peele didn't just manage to step away from the comedy safety net that he might have - he wrote, directed and produced it (and filmed in just 28 days). He created a movie that has a brilliant social commentary (without being preachy) with genuine shock/horror moments... along with being mostly unpredictable and original.
 James M 	  Funny movie, had scary parts and a good plot. Better than most other horror movies, at least for me.
 Chazzyc . 	  Good, but overrated. Nice suspense tale in the vein of a Twilight Zone ep.
 Claudia R 	  Great! Entertaining!!
 Lee B 	  Fantastic so different to most other horror/chillers. One of the best in a long while. Probably since lights out/ it follows. Genuinely unsettling and creepy. Well acted and the special effects during the hypnotism scenes really unsettled me. But anyway. It's a great movie and I'm glad it's doing well as it deserves to. Can't wait to watch it again. Hope you enjoy it too
 Alex H 	  This is basically a feature length episode of Black Mirror, which is saying an awful lot.
 LaVon L 	  Go see it. I saw it last night and I already want to go see it again.
 Jewel R 	  Awesome!!!!! Was killing me waiting for the movie to drop but totally worth the wait. Definitely adding to the collection!
 Bethany L 	  I just saw this film and I thought it was really good. To all of you in the comments complaining before you've even seen the film, wait
 Jacob M 	  Glaring in it's subtext without being overbearing, 'Get Out' is a thoughtful, entertaining and hilarious thriller that stands alone as it's own entity.
 Tom S 	  I still cannot believe this got made -- a scathing takedown of white tokenism masquerading as a comedy-thriller. It persuasively argues that comfy white Brooklyn liberals are eating fruit loops and rockin' to 80s pop while black people are fighting for their fucking lives. It's even more disturbing than "I Am Not Your Negro," a film that at least offered a path "Out." You'll watch this and wonder if there is one.
 Mark L 	  One Sentence Movie Review for March 19, 2017: Get Out is easily the best thriller I've ever seen, with tons of well done intense buildup, superb acting and writing, and one of the most surprising payoffs at the end I've ever seen in a theater.
 Die s 	  Wtf is up with the critics? This film was so stupid. Funny but stupid and not scary at all. Just as bad as or maybe even worse than lights out. Seems like critics will give any film great reviews if it fits the libtard agenda. This film should've marketed as comedy only because you can't take this crap that seriously. A film strictly aimed to dumb down the public.
 Heather M 	  Brilliant flick. So so so good on so many levels. Loved it! Go see it. And don't read any reviews before you do. Grab some popcorn and go! ??
 Narxco K 	  Loved it simple as that
 Jon L 	  The idea was excellent the delivery and script was less so there will undoubtedly be a sequel and it will definitely be woeful
 Stan G 	  I didn't really want to see this movie, I have never liked racial movies,I have to admit it was very good.
 Vladimir B 	  As thriller- not bad . All this interracial BS was not necessary - IMHO.
 Juan S 	  The most perfect horror film I have ever seen. So many layers to keep you on your toes at every turn.
 Gman H 	  I absolutely loved this movie - it was as close to perfection as you can get for this genre - genius!!! Not really scary, but creepy, very very creepy!Acting spot on throughout.And I didn't expect THAT at all![9/10]
 Bob W 	  A brilliant first outing for Jordan Peele of Key and Peele hilarity. Similar trenchant social commentary as Stepford Wives had back in the 70s, but actually much more thought provoking. Biting satirical snapshots of racism in our society are well placed, but this is a well acted, surprising and scary debut. Will cause you to laugh out loud and cringe. Tension an unease builds as you experience the kind of racialized interactions the main character endures but even more with the growing mystery. Hypnotic is an understatement!
 Lise W 	  Get Out and see it! Enjoyable movie and very clever. Not as scary as I thought yet still full of suspense. I can't wait to see more from Jordan Peele.
 Denise H 	  very very deep movie that opens your eyes, a must see for everyone.
 Jackson F 	  Jordan Peele transitions from comedy to horror very well with this movie. Not only is it really creepy but it also has a good satirical edge to it that balanced well with the other tones of the film.
 Juji O 	  It was really good, and that's about it. Not the best movie of the past decade. It could have been more tense. For example there were a lot of cheap scares, due to the fact that the director is a comedian, not Alfred Hitchcock. But the story's originality and extremely well written comedic relief pays off for a fun movie
 Josh L 	  loved this movie one of the best horror and comedy movies out there
 Lindsey G 	  Absolutely phenomenal! It had you guessing at every turn!
 Mohammed A 	  Amazing must watch one of the best movies 2017
 Gurjit a 	  Great movie but did cringe with some of the racial references!
 Andrea B 	  Fuck yes. That's all I have to say. JustFuckYes
 Rebecca H 	  Really liked this original and very creepy movie. Lots of 'make you jump' and shocking moments! Some laugh out loud comedy moments too. Would recommend.
 jackie a 	  I enjoyed it, but didn't have enough meat, for me
 Patrick F 	  This could have been a descent show, because it is different. But the truth is it is yest another example of Hollywood piling on the hate-the-white-people ban wagon. Almost all the humor was stereotypical white poeple jokes. I like the idea of hypnosis as a premise in a horror movie and the cinematography and music were good. I also liked the acting of the "hero". I enjoyed his performance in black mirror as well. Of course the tatometer critics give this 99% because to do otherwise is to unsympathetic to the plight of black people please. i am so sick of this. We are the human raxce. Everybody please shut up about black and white so we can be HUMANS. I sick of people trying to make me feel guilty for being born, I go to the movies to be entertained. This movie was NOT thought provoking at all. If you do not already know about the issues it pretends to address then you are an idiot. Let's stop attacking ALL people. ok?
 Charmarich Show  	  WoW,#GETOUT is the physical manifestation of what's going on mentally in the world today. Well done but unfortunately my spirit was troubled.
 Lara L 	  The concept of this movie and the use of structural racism to create suspense was ingenious. However, as much as I loved the components of this movie they didn't fit together well. Many of the themes were repeated without variation. I was ready for a new twist but kept getting the same twist over and over.
 Daniel H 	  1 of the worst movies I have seen. Very disappointing ending.
 Erica Q 	  This was a great movie! It was suspenseful, psychological and funny. It had an unexpected twist. Really good movie. I want to definitely watch it again.
 Amelie B 	  U have to watch the whole thing to understand but it's racist too.
 Panos M 	  While the manipulative screenplay offers some great plot twists, the rather disappointing ending weakens this first attempt in direction by the actor Jordan Peele. So, Get Out seems like a missed opportunity because the direction, the editing and the way the ominous music is used keep the pace and the suspense in a very high level. 6/10
 Charmayne J 	  I initially didn't want to see this movie, but my son asked me to go. I ended up loving the movie. It was great. I didn't expect it to be that good. Get Out is a must see.
 Roz B 	  Seriously? All the build up, so I finally went and schlepped my family to see it last night. OMG. Stupid, not scary, not suspenseful, just STOOPID.
 Gaynor J 	  We thought that concept was very good but it didn't fulfil its potential, it a slow build up without achieving any real suspense even with the addition of the Hitchcock like chords. The only time we jumped slightly was when the deer hit the car. I real disappointment after reading the reviews.
 Sami S 	  Very funny, very creepy. I loved it.
 London B 	  Instant Classic. Very Deep Movie.
 Nakisha J 	  This movie is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. The movie touches on racial issues/brainwashing that go back many years, but are still occurring in society now. The only way anyone can truly get the message in this movie is to have knowledge about black history and things that were done toward black people in slavery days and even ongoing. Great message, great movie.
 Keith J 	  Thought it was great. Funny and incisive. we definitely talked about it afterward. lots of funny stuff to laugh about. and a reminder that it is a horror flick.
 Jonathan B 	  Super fun movie. i really enjoyed all of it. never knew what was next. always intrigued. pretty funny too. i didnt love the style of performance. it was that coy style most of the time that bothers me and also often feels false. there was a bunch of moments im the film that acting wise (perhaps style or director is to blame too) that felt false to me. but again, i may be unfamiliar with the genre. it could be like someone saying that about wrestling, where as i would say, you probably dont understand the genre and style. i give the style that much credit because at the end of the day it was definitely a horror movie. for as much social/racial commentary as there was, it was still just a horror movie in teh end, so i didnt really know what to do with what i just saw. i showed me some racial things i dont usually see in movies which was wonderful, but then nothing of substance or subtantive to leave with.
 Ban D 	  Can you imagine a movie that depicts a town populated ONLY by evil LGTB people, who then lure innocent STRAIGHT people to transplant their evil LGTB brains into nice STRAIGHT people? Because we ALL know that LGTB are evil and secretly WANT to be STRAIGHT, right???OFFENSIVE, right???Now transpose WHITE for LGTB, and BLACK for STRAIGHT.Are you still offended?
 A.D. O 	  so good so gooooood, perhaps even more so because i went in not knowing at all what i was watching. thrills and giggles and biting social context at every turn.
 Morgan K 	  Best movie this year. The social commentary sets it apart from other thrillers. Must see in theatres.
 Jesse M 	  Left me filled with a unique and truly chilling anxiety. The movie made me walk in the shoes of a man expecting racism's usual and exhausting presence, who learned of a darker plot that he could've never foreseen. The acting was top notch but Jordan Peele's work is most impressive to say the least.
 Jamaal S 	  Scary Satire....new genre. Great story, great acting.
 Victoria P 	  Funny and thrilling at the same time. Jordan Peele did a wonderful job with this movie. For any black people like myself who love to see movies I would recommend seeing this because it's so relatable. In both good and bad ways lol. As for anyone else I think you could too have a laugh at how ironic this movie is. It's perfect for anyone no matter what race you are.
 Caleb J 	  One of the best that I ever have seen, in my lifetime.
 Alec C 	  As much as critics drooled over this film, it was on account of their emotional approach to movies, and for that reason only, that this film received a 99%. This film is merely great, but not excellent, because it does not build suspense like the other horror flicks, but builds fear and unnerving feels for the audience as a result of the cringe worthy race card that is played throughout the movie. It is great because of the outstanding acting performances by Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams. BUT! It does not have a very culminating and overwhelming climax, and it would seem that Daniel Kaluuya's Chris got out way to easy. It was basically a joke that the white people who captured him actually believed that they could keep him there. Not to mention the light innuendo of racism that Jordan Peele had in mind when screenwriting. But not towards blacks, but towards whites. By showing that black people like Chris are constantly humiliated by white racism, he is making middle class white liberals out to be the bad people. Since Chris also only socializes to the black groundskeeper and black housemaid, Peele is clearly trying to introduce the feel of segregation not only in this movie, but in this world overall. Great horror, humor, and acting, but terrible theme, interpretation, and opinion of African American victimization.
 Upendran M 	  Lot like the "Skeleton Key" but better; lot more convincing and a lot less scary!!
 Eva P 	  Absolutely hated it!
 Ariel C 	  Mr. Peele is a true artist.
 Tracy T 	  Enjoyed it... I really didn't think I would but I was surprised. This movie is funny, suspenseful and full of surprises. It was well acted and will give you a few things to think and talk about.
 Eddie V 	  That was the single WORST movie EVER made. Beyond pathetic!!!! I've never wanted my money back like that in my entire life. The positive reviews on this site are 100% LIES! This director and writer should be banned from the film industry. A complete waste of time and money.
 Jordan P 	  Deliciously tense, darkly humorous and conceptually terrifying, Get Out finds debuting writer-director Jordan Peele taking a satirical premise and turning it into something brilliantly original, with just enough intelligence and gore to deliver a predictable but engrossing look at modern American interracial prejudice.
 JamesWillie B 	  wow, was good, better than I expected
 Sean P 	  Amazing, when everything seemed so simple , Peele adds even more layers... Wonderfully done
 Scott V 	  Overall, a great film. A better overall film than it was specifically a horror. The comedic relief was almost too good for it to be simply a tension-breaker. Performances were strong, though the plot makes a lot less sense when watched a second time than it does while you're in the theater.
 Mike R 	  I have no idea why people would rate this movie so highly. It was same level as a midday Lifetime movie. If you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie. No twists ending. Wish I could get my money back
 Ann M 	  Wholly disappointing. Was expecting to be scared half to death but apart from a couple of mildly humorous parts, I was rather bored to death. Don't waste your money or your time is my advice.Had trusted Rottentomatoes up til now
 Me R 	  Good god. How terrible can a movie get! Read so many positives about it and then when we finally sit thru, it was TORTURE! How did anyone think this was any good. We kept trying to find something in it worth something but it was so bad it actually made me nauseated. When it was over we just looked at each other and said WTH! Acting out in garbage behavior based solely on color of skin was disgusting but this whole movie felt like an incredible waste of time and money. I am lost! Why did so many give this a good rating? I must be in another world because we simply HATED IT!
 Jack A 	  Get Out is decently entertaining but its plot at times can feel silly and contrived.
 Eddie G 	  This movie was a masterpiece. Not only was I on the edge of my seat the entire movie, but Peele keeps you scared with not jump scares, but purely the concept itself that scares you the most. When the movie is over, everything puts itself together like a puzzle. Best thriller I have ever seen.
 Trae K 	  Definitely one of those movies that made me think and fully process what has happened in the film afterward. People, please do NOT be fooled by the atrocious-looking previews, because this movie is so much deeper and much more solid than how the previews made it look. I honestly wasn't too blown away like I hoped I would be, but this film is still worthy enough to watch for its deep content.
 Lindsay J 	  Way better than I was expecting. Not super scary (I only jumped twice). Had a ton of funny parts too. Loved it.
 Mary W 	  Very well made and a great triller !
 adasilva72 . 	  Totally worth seeing
 Michael G 	  sick movie that shows racism is as strong as ever in American society
 Paige H 	  SUCH a good movie. While th movie has a slow start and seems very strange and awkward, the movie intensifies and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Get Out keeps throwing in plot twist until the very end. Highly recommend.
 Kai C 	  I love it when the black character survives!~
 Justin K 	  Enjoyable movie that was intriguing throughout, only concern is it's predictable plot.
 Josh M 	  Weaving some pretty good satire throughout, Get Out combines an interesting story with some really chilling atmosphere to create a thoroughly enjoyable, occasionally funny, horror experience.
 Jenna G 	  Hilarious, terrifying and SO entertaining. Get Out left me with no words. Just wow. Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams are outstanding, not to mention Keener and Whitford and LilRel Howery stealing every scene. Jordan Peele sure made a massive impression in his directorial debut. SEE THIS MOVIE!
 chris f 	  Predictable and dull. Some good individual performances but I don't see how this film merits the ratings it is getting.
 Jacob D 	  Absolutely brilliant, a funny comedy, a scary horror movie, and a genius satire, nearly a masterpiece!
 Mo B 	  Speechless! Best horror movie I've seen in decades. Like Steven King and Hitchcock had a baby!
 Darron T 	  Super Smart film. Got that Rosemary's Baby vibe mixed in with some a Clockwork Orange but all new idea so relevant to today. Hats off to Jordan Peele, great acting by Daniel Kaluuya and an awesome cast.
 Ivelise G 	  This movie was a real surprise, I did not even know anything about it but it. The levels of suspense and comedy are so well treated and balanced. Chris's role is amazing and the performance is impecable. It somehow mixes black mirror with American comedy.
 davlon s 	  highly recommended. great movie all around. Lots of drama and suspense.
 Brett B 	  Writer/director Jordan Peele's GET OUT is a very good horror film, and it's an even better satire. Biting, incisive, frightening, and funny, this is the total package, a movie with something to say even as it constantly entertains. Peele, brilliantly, does not take the obvious (read: stupid) route that this sort of social commentary could have gone, and instead focuses on a particular brand of unintentional and detached condescension, which he proceeds to absolutely skewer. Peele's story is totally unafraid of uncomfortable moments, and it's wonderful when a filmmaker feels like he's showing you something subversive, and his writing is razor sharp. He also reveals himself to be incredibly genre literate; the specter of the works of Ira Levin and things like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS can be felt (in a very good way, even as the movie's story never rips anything off), and the way he shoots the more suspenseful moments is incredibly effective. There are sequences here of tremendous tension and unease, and save a couple of unnecessary, cheap-o jump scares, the horrific component of the movie is unassailable. The movie is also genuinely funny (much of the humor courtesy of secret weapon Howery, who basically walks off with the entire film), but the humor never undercuts the stakes; there is real danger at play for our hero, and his emotional state is always played for real (and is very well conveyed by Kaluuya). GET OUT accomplishes many things, most important of which is that it becomes an incredibly satisfying, crowd-pleasing genre effort. It's one of 2017's best films.
 Jo E 	  Tightly structured and horrifying, truly talented film.
 CM S 	  It could have been a good plot had they left out all the racial phobia and propaganda which has become downright exhausting; even Daniel Kaluuya, a British actor, felt a little of the american obsession with racism when told by Samuel Jackson that an African American should have played that part because he knows the struggle... please, let it rest already, most of us don't care.
 Lloyd C 	  great movie! it had the perfect combination of comedy and suspense
 Mario U 	  Truly an exceptional movie.
 Aaron M 	  A movie that both brilliantly tells a story of being young and black in America, and drives a suspense horror theme that will have you on the edge of your seat. A must see for anyone that enjoys the suspense genre or wants a movie that breaks from the predictably drab narrative of most movies.
 Lauren A 	  One of the most intelligent and highly psychologically thrilling films I've seen in a long time. Would highly recommend it to anybody, as it has now set the bar extremely high for many of the other films due to be released later this year.
 Roun R 	  A Fresh Take On Horror With A Mix Of Racial Satire.
 Chu-lee M 	  u can hardly forget those big brown innocent eyes
 Matt K 	  Get Out is so good that leading health professionals warn that viewers will be overcome with feelings of wanting to discuss the script after leaving the theater. In fact, have any of you guys seen it? Can we talk?
 Bianca G 	  Definitely a must see!!!
 Donna N 	  Brilliant concept loved it
 Helena K 	  The best film I've seen in years.
 Kathy S 	  Awesome! Can't stop thinking about it.
 Sam W 	  A serviceable and entertaining horror film with some sinister moments and some funny moments. Very predictable story and events, as the almost immediate awkwardness from the characters gives a lot of the mystery away, but there are still some good clues and a tidy, if somewhat convenient, ending. I think it should have done more with the imagery, psychological mind games and potentially deep-rooted racism aspects of the plot.
 Christopher D 	  An instant classic.Peele takes the ordinary and makes it extraordinary. I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole time.What's more important is that this movie passed the logic test. All of the scenarios were totally relatable. There' situations you could find yourself in everyday, this is what makes this film enormously terrifying.
 Denise P 	  I think this movie went over a lot of people's heads. It does an excellent job at capturing the nonwhite experience in majorly-white (and racially insensitive) environment and that alone is scary as hell, let me tell you. Had it's funny moments but it was really more of a thriller. It was pretty excellent.
 Josie T 	  Wow!!! What a thriller, keeps you on your toes!!!!
 David K 	  The answer to racial issues isn't violence, but this movie reinforces that.It's a movie for a divided nation that wishes to remain so, not a nation looking to heal, and for that and the following reasons, it gets one star.It drew on unhealthy race/class cliche to get a reaction out of the audience. Hamfisted, it can't eloquently answer or handle ANY of the questions it asks. Instead, it scares people into not thinking critically about the film because "race!"I was ashamed at the people in the audience cheering near the end; not that the villain didn't get what was coming to them to an extent, but it felt like it all just enforced violence and racial tension.
 Temi T 	  Really good movie with surprise ending.
 Daniel H 	  Disturbing, funny, mental, plays with your mind... absolutely brilliant but crazy film. it will stay in your head for a long time after the movie has finished! mad!
 Will L 	  Great movie. I won't spoil it but look for hidden messages
 Travis M 	  Overall an awesome movie. It's hard for me to call it a "Horror" movie to me it's more so a "Psychological Thriller". But regardless, great acting, awesome cinematography, and impressive work for Jordan Peele's first movie he directed.
 Aaron T 	  If you enjoyed The Visit then you'll probably recognise the same brand of 'is this funnier than it is terrifying?' horror.It's pretty much how I imagine a UKIP-majority country village would react if a non-white should accidentally venture there.
 M C 	  Best movie of 2017 hands down, if you don't go see anything else, make sure that you see this film. No 3D glasses or CGI, no ghimic just great story telling. Horror is back in a major way thanks to get out. I f**king loved this movie.
 Victor J 	  Get Out refuses to pull any punches with its constant and honest social commentary, but walks the line between enchanting narrative and revelatory eye-opener deftly. The greatest moments in Get Out are moments that are so normal to the viewer, when it's obvious something is very wrong. We are forced to avert our gaze no longer and truly ponder the world we live in.
 Simone W 	  I know of quite a few interracial couples that have fights stemming from this movie. To be honest, I don't understand why...
 Derius J 	  Great movie! Haven't seen a thought provoking film in a long time.
 Zachiary B 	  Although it may tell you to, you do not want to GET OUT. This is a film that takes horror cliches and makes them conform to its standards, serving a horror film that, while still delivering the scares, also stands to start a conversation about "liberal racism" and the opression of African-Americans in America.
 Luqman S 	  A very perceptive and clever film on race.
 Jason M 	  I am confounded by the critics and audience reviews of this movie. In fact, it was the 99% rating that got my wife and I to see this movie. I will no longer give such credence to the rotten tomatoes ratings, thats for CERTAIN.This movie was horrible and predictable with cheesy one liners (that I have to assume just passed the bar for the "comedy" label). The only thing funny about the movie was that some people in the audience were sucked in by it. Save your money or go see something good. This is NOT it.
 Dalton V 	  What manages to elevate this movie beyond simply being a pseudo-remake of Guess Whose Coming to Dinner? is the twists, thrills, and laughs it presents while dealing with the tense subject matter of race in a near perfectly executed subtle manner. It's in the slight dialogue exchanges, the symbolism of a silver spoon, and the fear in a black man's eyes, no longer the fear of a clichd blonde girl fearing a hyper masculine black man, but that black man's own fears. Peele is not afraid to show fear of suburbia, "diet racism" enjoyed by middle/ upper-class liberals, and exposes a veneer of prejudice among that so often goes unnoticed. Get out of your house and go see Get Out, 2017's best film yet.
 Ford P 	  One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. In order for a spooky film to be spooky, the characters have to make the same decisions you would make. Thats a mandatory for pretty much every movie, but especially scary ones. This main character, (Chris), had so many opportunities to realize he needs to get the fuck out of there ASAP. The whole first night was a completely twisted situation, once the grounds keeper had solidified it was not a dream, Chris should have been packing his bags. The grounds keeper was sprinting in the dead of night in the dark and Chris didnt even question him on why exercise at night? The mother hipnotized him against his will and he doesnt want to make a big deal out of it? Plus, how could Chris not realize the mother was up to something when she does the cliche turn on light while sitting in the dark and then stirs her tea without sipping immediately after discussing hypnosis. The pinnacle being when he snapped the photo and the flash sent the brain swapped black man who had been missing into a panic. I understand Chris staying with his girl for a bit by the sunset, sex makes you stupid, but he easily could have said he wanted to take her car now and she could stay to collect his stuff instead of him hanging out for the next hour until the Sun is down. Any reasonable girlfriend wouldnt force their guy to stay somewheres they feel in danger. Now that its clear it should have never gotten to the second evening to want to get the fuck out of there.  When the evening comes and its just the family at home they double down on the character decisions that make no sense. First off, Rose being against him shouldve been considered by him when she couldnt find the keys. I mean shes fairly young and these are her parents not some distant Uncles shes never met, dont you think maybe just maybe shes one of them since she is literally one of them. As soon as she couldnt find the keys i wouldve been grabbing the bag. As a matter of fact, why would she actually have them after all? They knew shit was going down that night and they didnt think marybe this guy could pull off a miracle and steal the unhidden keys and drive away? I mean the only physical threat was the brother who armed himself with the lacrosse stick (instead of the gun!!!) and the mom with her cup. Its unlikely for him to make it out but shit happens. Now that hes been captured and is tied and the truth comes out (ill get to that later). The brother comes to get Chris for the surgery, why would the brother just assume Chris is asleep and how could he not notice Chris getting into that very advantageous hitting position when he is one foot away? Chris then presumably kills the brother based on the blood coming from the blunt trauma to the head, i mean he hit him a few good times with a rock basically. Chris then goes onto kill the father with antlers from a deer head. Did Chris forget that UFC was too hardcore for him? Because he isnt even flinching, but its life or purgatory so ill let it slide since this may be the first rational move by Chris. Now Chris is finally smart enough to smash the moms tea cup and blocks a knife with his palm (badass shit, ill let it slide for the previous reasons). As Chris leaves, the brother comes back despite a major head injury and instead of using the gun they have, he musters up some serious energy to go for the rear naked choke but at no surprise fails, This time the brother is dead right? Rose still heard none of this (some damn good noise cancelling ear buds she has!). As Chris makes his escape he forgets that hes been told all the black people are really white people and decides to pick up the grandma who hasnt forgotten who she is. Chris being attacked by the grandpa and Rose (who brought a gun) . Chris is smart enough to take a picture as a last ditch resort. Rose seems to have forgotten that taking a picture of these transferred mind people makes them crazy. So she gives the man shes assuming is still her grandpa the gun and old man jenkins finishes her and himself off leaving Chris a free man.  Now i havennt forgotten the best friends side story in this. The best friend was well done. The two main problems with his story though are how unbelievably the police handled his information (just ridiculously unbelievable) and how he got a cop car. Plus why did Chris ask how he found him? Why wouldnt Chris have texted him the address he was at?  In terms of being a comedy, it had its few moments to get laughs with the cliche sitting in the dark to turning a light on surprise scene and when they have a big blown up picture of Chris while voting like they were frat bros voting on new pledges.  The key problem with this movie was that none of the decisions make sense. As i write this review i realize this may have been a spoof on horror films. If so, it wasnt that bad....
 Brian B 	  Finally got out to see Get Out tonight with the girls. Excellent. Loved it. There aren't a lot of movies I want to see more than once right away but this is one of them.
 Christine H 	  Thoroughly engaging and so well-written and not scary - suspenseful, thrilling, slightly bloody & gory, but not a "horror" movie as one might expect. The social commentary is cutting and brilliant. Go see it!
 William R 	  This a complete stink bomb. Not one redeeming attribute. Makes me think all these reviews are fake. Makes Ed Wood look like Demille.
 Miranda R 	  Amazing movie! Loved it all!
 James P 	  Best movie I've seen in years.
 Nathan R 	  Really just entertaining in every way that matters. Peele's directorial debut is a rare horror flick that escapes the thresholds of the genre.
 Ellen S 	  By far the stupidest movie I have EVER seen..demanded & got our money back with the other 6 people who were in the theater with us..these actors were hard up for money to do THIS movie!!!!!
 Abshir A 	  I'm TS muthaf***** A
 Im I 	  Flipping fantastic!I wouldn't categorise it as a horror, it's more of a suspense thriller, with a seriously good dollop of humour flung in for good measure.Very entertaining and quite novel
 Fred R 	  Excellent movie, waited weeks to see, but the reviews drew me to see it. well worth the $$ and time
 Sophie C 	  Holy shit. I was stressed out and feeling the adrenaline from this movie for half an hour after I left the theater. Love the music selections and the social commentary is sharp and all the more effective for the fact that it's not overdone. Many cringeworthy moments that are made so because they hit close to home in the world we live in.
 Myles E 	  Wait for it to come out on TV. Not worth the cinema tickets. An eerie start leaving you wondering where it was going, followed by a middle full of anticipation and an ending that was far too quick where you're left feeling something was missing.
 Maxine W 	  An absolutely terrifying tale wrought with suspense, horror and even comedy just so you don't feel quite so traumatised by the end. A masterpiece of twisted genius.
 A.c. M 	  This is a good and entertaining movie. Reading through the reviews on RottenTomatoes it isn't what some are making it out to be. Those looking for a sharp critique on race won't find it here--the ending completely shatters any racial trope set out in the first act. I also didn't fit it to be a horror type scare fest with jump cuts, screeching violins and - with one exception - creepers in the background. I won't give anything away that wasn't already in the trailer by saying Admiral Ackbar should have been included somehow. Catherine Keener is effective and the story moves along reasonably well. Some of the foreshadowing feels like foreshadowing as it is happening instead of something recalled a bit later in an "aha!" moment. It's an original story and the reviews linking the story elements to the Stepford Wives do Get Out an injustice. Tonal comparisons to the Stepford Wives are apt, This movie doesn't need to be seen on the big screen to be enjoyed as it doesn't rely on CGI, panoramic shots, or action sequences. In this day and age that alone makes it worth seeing.
 Mazola E 	  Crazy as hell... but it was a good movie.. first one like it...
 Brad R 	  This is a fantastic horror movie that's also a satire on white liberal racism. Yup, liberals can be racist too. The liberals in this movie aren't rednecks, or neo-Nazis, or KKK members. They are those kinds of people who think they are egalitarian and tolerant, but never actually talk to black people, and when they meet a black person they go overboard on trying to be nice to them. Yeah, I think we all have met one or two people like that. Racism comes from all sides of political spectrum and this movie does a great job at bringing attention to this fact.5 stars!
 Brad S 	  Easily one of the best three horror movies I've seen in the last 10 years...maybe ever.
 Kristin R 	  This may not be your typical horror, but it is still horrifying. Tense, nail-biting and some fantastic acting. Get Out managed to set a tone that should make most people extremely uncomfortable, and it kept the tension up from start to finish. Never have I watched a horror movie where I had such strong feelings about the lead character surviving! This film is extremely smart, and a interesting take on race relations and 100% worth watching.
 Jaromir E 	  An original idea that turns out to be a very fun, thought-provoking, clever movie. The script, acting, music, and other theatrical elements you'll experience throughout the movie will invade your soul... and give your heart one hell of a race.
 Ryan C 	  Just came back from watching this movie. Overall it was a nice change of direction for a thriller movie, my only bad opinion on this movie is i felt the ending was rushed. The ending could of gone in a diffrent direction with maybe a plot twist or a "oh that never happened moment" but of course thats only my opinion. Still with that said great movie maybe not everyone's taste in thriller.
 Dana P 	  "Get Out" is obviously not your typical clich horror movie. The horror in this film is not like most, it has a touch of reality in regards of racism. It has the element of paranoia causing the real scare, who would ever thought a constant clicking of a teacup could do some much damage to put someone in a "sunken place" just genius. Shocking and funny with so many twists just WOW honestly.The protagonist of the movie, Chris is invited by his girlfriend Rose to meet her parents during a weekend getaway. Chris is curious about her parents' reaction to their daughter's interracial relationship since she never told them that she is in a relationship with a black guy. As the weekend progresses, shocking truths are revealed where the urge to GET OUT is necessary. Once he arrives to her home the environment just automatically shouts something odd with her family only having black workers. They try to normalize that to him but still comes across as strange. From the start of an awkward warm welcome from the parents to an uncomfortable lawn party with family and friends. It is suspenseful and psychological terror with the right amount of humor. After seeing this movie it made me think a lot and notice that there are so many subliminal messages throughout this movie. It is definitely unforgettable and a must see.
 Bob S 	  Is it possible for a movie to be both stupid and smart? both blunt and subtle? Generally speaking, "no". But in the case of a film like "Get Out", the answer is very much "yes". "Get Out" is a movie of contradictions. As opposed to being a weakness, the contradictions are completely the point and the movie radiates with them.This is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele. Better known as the second half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, a duo that has forayed into the movies since the end of their series. Last year it was the comedy "Keanu" and now we have Peele by himself behind the camera. For a directorial debut, he shows a real eye for using the camera as an integral aspect of storytelling. Also, he seems to inherently understand what makes good horror work: it's not necessarily what you see that scares you, but what lurks just out of sight.Further, if this movie was just a skillfully directed horror piece that would be impressive enough, but hung within this horror framework are instances when it also manages to be an entertaining comedy. Without giving anything away, there are two moments of spectacularly jarring musical choices that should jolt the audience out of the movie. Nevertheless, due to the way that the movie is woven together, they become humorous moments without breaking any of the tension.If all you want is a horror movie that avoids the worst cliches of the genre (e.g. annoying characters doing truly stupid things) then you should enjoy yourself just fine. However, there is so much more to uncover within this movie.You might be able to guess from the ads that racism plays a pivotal role in this movie. Yet, no one in this movie gives the appearance of being a traditional racist. The movie is much to savvy to depict stereotypical racism. Instead, it delves into far more insidious forms of racism and, by doing so, many of the same story elements could be used to examine any form of prejudice.On closer inspection, this film exceeds the expectations of a comedic horror movie wherein brain transplant surgery is a real thing. Just as with prejudice, if you take this film at face value, then you've missed the subtle undertones that give life depth. Peele retells a moral told many times before, yet somehow manages to make it feel fresh and interesting.Peele's directing career is off to a very strong start. I'm exciting to see what he makes next.
 Brian S 	  It's official. My butt is sore from squirming in my seat so much in this movie.
 Theodore C 	  A very clever and we'll executed play on one of the basic primal fears of all black people. Which is partly the reason for the craze and pop phenomenon surrounding it. There's also tons of cleverly placed subliminal elements for the thoughtful movie goer. I give it a stone cold 4.5 for fantastic execution.
 Jake B 	  So many layers, so many questions to think about long after the movie. Nobody plays a bougie white girl like Allison Williams (or Marnie from "Girls"). Overall, a very creative and well-executed horror/thriller that is a must-see!
 Bill J 	  Terrible! What racist movie! The message is all old white people are evil and want to be black.
 Ashley C 	  very boring... watched bc the previews made the movie looking amazing but was very disappointed.
 Ian T 	  Pretty silly. I started laughing when the neurosurgeon villain used his sterile gloves to pull his surgical mask over his beard! Pretty much kept laughing from there on.
 Joe F 	  meh,.. no Idea why it got all the high marks, I mean it was ok. Was advertised as a comedy horror.. Had one extra added a few jokes acting like an idiot. Thats about it. First hour or so was BORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRING... finally picked up a little bit. Big reveal wasnt hard to figure out, no real surprised, couple stupid gotcha things to make you jump, but not scarey, not funny. Kinda dry.Guess if you are black and want to watch exaggerated white people act clueless its ok.
 Jeje W 	  So I got back from Get Out about 50 minutes ago and I gotta say, that movie blew me away. I thought this movie was going to be absolutely terrible. It just looked so cheesy and dumb. But this is one of the smartest, most ambitious movies I've ever seen, maybe next to The Lobster. Almost everything about this film is perfect except the sometimes inconsistent soundtrack and how the film cuts out a few shots we saw in the trailer out of the movie. And the music sometimes drowns out what the characters were saying. Another problem is that there were a lot of unnecessary jumpscares. There were some that the main character didn't even see and the movie would just play a loud noise. Other than that, this movie was flawless. It was painfully funny. It is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Which in itself is funny because this is a horror movie. And it is horrifying. It is creepy suspenseful, eerie, and, one again, smart. The acting was really terrific in this movie. Daniel Kaluuya gives an Oscar worthy performance. If I rated movies based on how much I liked them, I would give Get Out a 10. But since I rate them on how good they are, I'm going to give Get Out an 8/10.
 Alex V 	  Wow! Unique thriller that really has you until the end. The lead steals. Special.
 Kayla A 	  I always enjoy thrillers that don't contain only mindless jump scares but rather dig deeper and create twists that leave you shocked and thinking of the movie days after.
 Diana L 	  basically the only thing that could've made it better was it it had been longer. too short of a movie.
 Tommy M 	  Title should really be.. White People are Fucking Crazy
 Daniela L 	  I NOW UNDERSTAND THE MEMES Comedy intertwines with tragedy and horror in Jordan Peele's savvy, stylish and enormously entertaining film. Even though it start as your run-of-the-mill social discomfort movie, it gets very Grand Guignol towards the end.
 Elijah L 	  Get Out caught me off guard. From the god-awful trailers I expected it to be a preachy cringe-fest. It absolutely wasn't. It's funny, disturbing and still delivers the classic scares we've come to expect from the genre. I couldn't have asked for it to end more satisfyingly either.
 Kyle V 	  'Get Out' effortlessly blends the social mood of racism and manages to be humorous, intense, and horrifying, resulting in an entertaining and solidly executed horror/comedy film. Chris' girlfriend, Rose, insists that Chris meet her parents, inviting him to a weekend getaway upstate. Initially, Chris is accommodated warmly by the parents, believing this is their attempt to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of disturbing truths leads him to discover something unimaginable. On display throughout the film is the comically affable setup by the house help and the inadvertent, uneasily revealing, racism from the family. Our protagonist Chris is in a suspenseful position, he's on a weekend getaway to meet his white girlfriend's parents and family members while being mindful of the awkwardly warm welcome he is receiving. The family members and friends, on the annual lawn party, try to engage with Chris and they end up making him uncomfortable. Rose's father says 'I would've voted for Obama if he had a third term.' A former golf player tells Chris he knew Tiger Woods. And another guest, a black guest, shakes Chris' hand when offered a fist bump. The setup seems like a sitcom rousing a social farce. 'Get Out' triumphs from its execution, deftly knowing when to deploy and balance the suspense and humor. It's all playful yet flinch and the next thing you know, you're at the edge of your seat. 'Get Out' is most definitely a horror film than a comedy. Fans of the genre won't be surprised by the plot, the excess of violence, and chaos. Though what will surprise them, and much of the audience, is the incorporation of racial paranoia as it happens to be the basis for the violence. This film is an attack on the tension surrounding the questions of the marginalized, which the film replies with a death stare. Overall, 'Get Out' is unforgettable, despite that it matches the tropes of conventional horror/thriller films, because of how it handles the spirit of the matter while making it a solid film to enjoy.
 Vicki B 	  pretty weird, funny ...all in all good entertainment
 Juniper H 	  Stunning A breath of fresh airA must see
 Brent E 	  A stunning directorial debut for Jordan Peele replete of any plot holes whatsoever. Absolutely inspiring work.
 Greg B 	  "Get Out" is a Blumhouse production about an African- American man and his Caucasian girlfriend who are traveling to visit her parents for the weekend. The boyfriend is concerned that her parents won't tolerate their interracial relationship. What unfolds is a horror comedy where the boyfriend makes a dark discovery about the family and its intentions. This film is bizarre and twisted in ways I can't describe without spoiling. I found it unnerving but also not fleshed out enough. It is hard to give a concise review without spoiling this film, but. Suffice it to say it is bizarre and twisted in every sense of the word. It is also exceptionally racist. I am reminded of Margaret Sanger from this movie. Watchable but underdeveloped ------------------------------------- B-
 Emanuel F 	  Easily one the craziest movies I've ever seen! Definitely worth the price of admission. Jordan Peele brought terror back to the big screen!
 JP A 	  Original, inventive, stylish, funny, and scary all at the same time; a welcomed surprise from unexpected talent at the helm with a great script and cast.
 Jordan J 	  Get Out has to be one of the most original and greatest modern horror movies I've ever seen. No movie has ever been as thrilling and suspenseful as this movie. This movie is also brave to venture into the R zone unlike most horror movies these days. What's so great about the suspense and thrills is that it makes the movie extremely scary if it's your first time watching. The movie is also clever with its reveals and twists. One great thing about this movie is that normally too much gore in a horror movie ruins it, but in this movie it just adds to the scary factor. Another amazing thing is that this movie is directed by Jordan Peele. Just wow he did a great job with this movie. He really did a great job with mixing up comedy with horror. This movie just found a way to be scary and extremely funny at the same time. This movie just kept finding ways to impress everyone and won't disappoint. Can't wait for DVD release. Overall this is just an amazing movie and makes the most of what it has. A+
 Curtis M 	  I went into this movie with really high expectations because there was so much hype to it and for the most part it lived up to all the praise it has been getting. For starters, Jordan Peele wrote a wonderful script and did a fantastic job directing this movie. It had a couple of dumb jump scares and irrelevant scenes (like the man running randomly in the woods) but it totally provided tension and comedy. It was such a happy medium of being a satire and horror film. Peeled was able touch on a pretty heavy topic in racism and addressed it in a way without forcing it. Some of these things that seemed so out of the ordinary were things that people actually say to a different race and it was portrayed very well. The lead actor did a great job and I'm sure we will be seeing more of him and I also thought his added a comedic relief and always stole the show when he was on screen. I don't know if I really thought it was scary and if it held as much suspense as it wanted to but it was extremely entertaining and it is definitely worth the watch.
 Laken B 	  Best horror flick I've seen in a long time. Reminded me a bit of Skeleton Key. Hoping there are deleted scenes when they release it on DVD
 Phillip O 	  As my wife says, "Get Out...and go see it!" I enjoyed every minute of it, mostly 'cause...I've seen some of those people before. Sly as can be, and sure to leave the blissfully unaware uncomfortable.
 Daniel L 	  Fantastic movie about modern racism. It'll be in your head for days. See it with an audience if you can.4.5/5 = Must-See
 Wen P 	  Interesting storyline but not done well. Cheesy and slow.
 Renee B 	  Kudos to Peele for making a horror film that has not been made before.. Some of the "why's" could of been answered a little more thoroughly, but Get Out is equal parts comedy and suspense, which is worth the watch.
 Jarett P 	  I would NOT reccomend seeing this movie, its far from the worst movie ever, but even further from the most mediocre movie ever... acting 8/10, story 2/10...
 Davia A 	  Almost everything is a part of my personal nightmare.
 Vicki M 	  excellent movie, I saw it twice
 Ahmed S 	  Was alright didn't think this was a 5 star movie in my eyes. Decent story has some laughs in it but overall didn't have the same kind of feel as other scary movies have.
 Neesha F 	  This movie makes Minions seem like Oscar gold. Slow, pointless, and boring as heck. You will want to get out of the theater...in which case, I did. Why it received 99% I will never know. Perhaps, one of the dumbest movies you will see this year.
 Leif E 	  Predictable and uncomfortable. A thriller should lure you in and make you want to see more. We left half way through this moving because we found it mundane and regurgitated dialog and subtext. Also, lets have another movie or show that pushes the race thing in our faces...please...we haven't heard enough about that lately. It feels like everywhere we look someone is trying to capitalize on that subject and here's yet another painful exploitation. I have no idea why this movie is scoring so highly with critics. This seemed like every other thriller with much less exciting cinematography and insanely lowbrow dialogue. The acting was decent at times, then over the top the next scene. A couple characters stood out in their performances and the other...well...Let's get back to the days of movies like "The Usual Suspect". Intelligent and engaging movie making. Not this stuff that is made to pull people into the movie to make a buck.
 Ben L 	  There's been a lot of hype around Get Out, but I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it because I hate horror and didn't feel like there was much that would surprise me after seeing the trailers. I was so wrong! Get Out is marvelous thriller that kept shocking me with revelations throughout. I can't remember the last time I walked out of a movie so thoroughly impressed by the way the director and his team paid attention to every minute detail. While I can't describe exactly what is meant by everything, it seemed that every prop, every line of dialogue, and every shot was telling me something important. It's the kind of movie that has a great surface-level story, but if you are willing to dig in deeper, there's so much more to see. In particular, the film has a lot to say about the modern state of racism in America. As with all the best movies, Get Out still has me thinking about it days later. The great thing about this movie is that, as I stew on it, I keep realizing new things I missed the first time through. Every time I try to find a flaw, suddenly I realize that it makes perfect sense in light of later revelations. One of the things that I was afraid would never work are the moments that seem manufactured just to build tension. They have people acting in odd ways and typical jump scares, and I was ready to write them off as pointless nonsense used to meet the horror quota. But on reflection it all fits in ways that I didn't even see on first glance. More than most movies, I think Get Out will benefit from a second watch because you can put all the pieces together when you know the ending. Everyone in the cast of this movie absolutely nails their part. I could run down the list, but it would just exhaust every positive adjective I know. Most of the cast is forced to play very nuanced roles and some of them even have to adjust later in the movie because of certain plot points. Of special note is the star Daniel Kaluuya who has a perfect American accent, that never betrays his actual country of origin. When a movie is as well-acted, well-plotted, and well-shot as this you have to give a massive amount of credit to the writer-director Jordan Peele. You can tell that he has a real passion for these kind of movies because of how he manages to pay homage to them, and he even takes familiar tropes and turns them around. Get Out is one of the smartest movies I've seen in a long time and it transcends any one genre. I highly recommend it.
 August V 	  First time time director Jordan Peel flawlessly weaves racial overtones into his well-realized, highly entertaining film. The acting is great, the writing and direction are on-point; altogether, it's a stellar movie
 Nick P 	  Despite the hype, it blew me away. Incredible and brilliant. It was like a superbly written homage to the classic horror film. Psychological, suspenseful, and with just the right amount of comedy. Jordan Peele, I don't think anyone knew you had this in you. How does it feel?I literally felt like I was being delivered a favour, with the biggest smile on my face through the first half of the film. As if it was a big thank you to horror fans. It's like he took a comical idea, and made it real, and eerily effective. I look forward to his next film.
 Barbara B 	  The movie was excellent! Definitely an eccentric spin on the plot and the parents!
 Migs R 	  Not as tense as I thought, but the social commentary used to create a horror scenario was scathing. Good directorial debut from Peele. I watched this twice because I didn't catch everything the first viewing. Bugged out for sure.
 Christian G 	  Nahhh ....I wish I never seen this
 Wuerner R 	  Very well done story and enough suspense and awkwardness to keep you on your seat. Not many movies can accomplish that nowadays.
 Justin K 	  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My girlfriend & I both wanted to get out of the movie theatre.
 Alma R 	  Very good, suspenseful, and nailbiting.
 Nica M 	  Pros: The lighting, angles and overall cinematography were pretty well done, and so were the graphics for the hypnosis scenes. The actors, the comedic scenes and the plot twists definitely made the movie more enjoyable-especially the fact that the protagonist didn't die! So did the moments of character cleverness, and bits of witty dialogue. There was definitely an emotional attachment developed towards the protagonist (through the memory of his mother passing) making the viewer actually watch until the end, and have a desire to know the outcome of the plot. Cons: The movie had potential and an attention-grabbing idea, but there were too many unanswered questions, too many loopholes. The story line began strong, pretty intriguing, and unique, however, after the plot twist occurred (the protagonist finding the collection of his girlfriend's photos) the rest of movie moved much too rash. This took away from the complexity of the story-line and any build up of suspense, making the movie predetermined and predictable. It's almost as if the writers got lazy, so they decided to have the overpowered protagonist kill everyone. I found the concepts introduced in the movie were lacking in terms of depth, and speaking of depth, they could have delved much deeper into some of the other characters pasts-like the mother, to better fully develop the setting and relation to the characters. I don't think the movie was meant to be Oscar-winning, or even that serious. Definitely not a memorable movie, overall it was OK, not that bad, but not great.
 Ariel C 	  Amazing. Jordan Peele and the cast are brilliant. The underlying message is so on point without being right out there in your face. As a white woman I can never truly understand what it is like to be a person of color, but a movie like this helps open my eyes and opens a dialogue.
 Katie S 	  Seriously? People are saying this is a good movie!? I'll admit the premise at first was engaging but then it went into some weird sci-fi movie type of thing. Totally exaggerated story line, the only thing that was somehow relatable to today's racial issue was that he was black and they were white. Make them both white and this movie is ridiculous. The story line sucked.
 Derick V 	  best movie of the year hands down...
 Le Le H 	  Great plot, great acting. My only complaints are that it's a little slow and there could have been more of a background story told.
 Michael S 	  "Get Out" | C+ | If ever there was a film to completely expose the flaw in RottenTomatoes rating system, this is it. 99% "fresh" is laughable. "Get Out" is a predictable, mildly entertaining film, not an "A" or even a "B."
 Deyen S 	  Best horror movie I've ever seen. Extremely well done. Super scary and nerve racking
 Robert H 	  Interesting take on the power of race juxtaposed by elements of horror. Guess who's coming to dinner meets rosemary baby.
 Jake C 	  Get Out is a fantastic satire of horror that will get everyone in the theater laughing and on their toes when they should, due to an impressive debut from Jordan Peele.
 Julio M 	  Well thought out plot. Tiny plot holes at worst, and the well to do uncomfortable experience when a person of color enters into a "white" household that means well (obviously not in this case) is perfect.
 Murray H 	  A poignant commentary on race in America meets a classic horror film meets a laugh-out-loud comedy. I'll see this movie as long as they'll keep it in the theater.
 Sarah S 	  Ooowww a must see!!!!
 Patrick L 	  "Intelligent, scary and surprisingly funny, "Get Out" is truly one of the best horror films to come out in years and it's an extraordinary filmmaking debut from writer and director Jordan Peele of "Key & Peele" fame"Movie Review: Get OutDate Viewed: March 4 2017Written and Directed By Jordan PeeleStarring: Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, Caleb Landry Jones, Lil Rey Howery, Betty Gabriel, Marcus Henderson, LaKeith Stanfield, Stephen Root and Erika Alexander.What are you waiting for? Get Out and see "Get Out" because all the buzz and critical acclaim is real. It's truly one of the best horror films to come out in years and it's an extraordinary filmmaking debut from writer and director Jordan Peele of "Key & Peele" fame. It's not only a horror film, it's also a savvy satire as well blending both social and racial issues to the forefront. Sort of a cross between "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" and "The Stepford Wives", "Get Out" centers around a black man who's dating a white woman and when she takes him to meet her parents, the mom and dad start to develop strange behavior around the black man because he's in an interracial relationship with their daughter."Get Out" is an intelligent, scary, funny and effectively creepy thrill ride that will make a perfect viewing for any black person who's afraid of police officers and the Trump era. The parents here aren't exactly presented as racists but you will still puzzled and afraid by them anyway. I don't know how Jordan Peele came up with this idea or convinced the studio executives that this concept would make for a great horror flick but he has accomplished the impossible with this film. Even though the year is early, "Get Out" is one of the best movies I've seen this year so far.The film follows an African-American photographer named Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) as he and his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) go on a weekend trip to meet the parents. Chris quickly gets nervous about meeting Rose's parents because it might get uncomfortable and they might be concerned about their daughter dating a black man. When he does meet the parents, Dean and Missy Armitage (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener), they both seem like nice people with Dean even explaining that he would've voted for Obama if he had to serve a third term. The parents introduce Chris to their maid (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper (Marcus Henderson) and he immediately notices their strange slave, zombie-like behavior. Dean and Missy seem to be developing strange behavior as well as they ask him questions about his smoking addiction and his late mother. When Missy offers to hypnotize Chris to cure his smoking habit, he thinks that there might be a link between Missy's hypnotizing and the slave-like behavior in the maid and the groundskeeper. With a heightened sense of fear, Chris calls his best friend and TSA officer Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery) for help and he tells him about the unusual behavior that surrounds Rose's parents and their maid and groundskeeper. When Rod looks up online about a months-old disappearance of another black man, Andre Hayworth (LaKeith Stanfield), he warns Chris to get out as fast as possible.The ending gets a little predictable and soft but nevertheless the big twists in this movie are chilling and the satire works like clockwork. Writer and director Jordan Peele has crafted a horror film that's both clever, witty and stylish. The performances from Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are all terrific. Kaluuya is the key to the movie because he walks an intense tight-rope of being both charismatic and psychologically afraid.Even though it's a Blumhouse Production, Jordan Peele doesn't fall for any of the usual genre trappings and he goes all the way with his story which has echoes to classic Hollywood thrillers. "Get Out" is a near-perfect horror film that takes the issues of racism, slavery and other social topics and blends them together to make a biting satire of the black man's fear of the white man.
 Stephanie H 	  Enjoyed this movies plot! Unexpected of how different this movie was; it's not like anything I've seen. Great cast! Loved the mystery, action, and comic relief!
 Tim S 	  Great concept. Had a few flaws but kept my interest the whole time
 Audrey S 	  Excellent movie. Outstanding job by Peele.
 Sarah H 	  I seriously DO NOT understand why this has such a high rating. So was not worth my money, wished I would have waited until it hit *Amazon LOL....For real this is barely a "thriller"..................
 Taylor C 	  Reminded me of the film The Skeleton Key with Kate Hudson. Suspenseful and creative.
 R R 	  Are you kidding me? One of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. My buddy and I were laughing about it half way thru. Nothing but an old B Rated flick. Aweful. How did this thing get such high ratings???. Funniest thing that has come out of the film is the "Get Out" challenge!
 David C 	  Good horror films normally have tension, so I'm kind of confused by the amount of praise this movie's received.There was almost no tension whatsoever. It simply feels like Peele doesn't really know what to do half the time, so he makes the scenes weird instead. It's not horror if you're just weirded out. There aren't many real scares if any at all, and I don't think I jumped once during the whole movie. I actually fell asleep, and no, it's not because I was hypnotized. The ending was atrocious. Having a good climactic ending is difficult, but you can't just say, okay we'll have the lead just kill everybody without much of a fight. That doesn't keep an audience on the edge of their seats. It was fairly obvious they didn't know how to approach the ending. Lastly, if this movie didn't have social commentary on race, no one would be talking it. You could argue that's why it's worth watching, and I'd agree, but that doesn't make it a good horror movie.
 Cathy L 	  Saw the movie and expected much more than all the hype. The film moves in different directions where I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be serious, lighthearted, funny, a spoof, a thriller or a social statement and then at the end it completely changes to ridiculousness. What a disappointment. It's like no one knew how to wrap it up so they just got silly. The acting was good. The comedy was fair with a few giggles. The twist was the best. Overall the film was hardly worth raving about. Seems like a lot of work went into it for a plot not worth its while.
 Mark B 	  EXTREMELY well delivered! The story was innovating and lends LOTS to social commentary; some in the form of "Easter Eggs", that are wondrous. I haven't seen a "Shawshank Redemption" level film in a while, so this was a most welcome experience!
 Filipe C 	  Interesting genre-bending experiment that proves Jordan Peele as a talent-to-watch. The big fault of Get Out, however, is a build-up that lasts for too long and a release that is all but too quick. The sense of rhythm is off and in the meantime we lose the scares, the thrills and the tension.
 Mike D 	  I went into this film excited and eager after hearing the stark reviews. A quarter of the way into the film I started to realize I was hating every moment. This was a predictable, juvenile, irrational plot full of loop holes. It tried to be smart and edgy with its racial stirrings but ended up feeling like a Key & Peele skit that wasn't meant to make you laugh. The character development was horrible and the plot was insulting and laughable. I really feel like one reason it is receiving so many accolades is because critics are afraid to say it's mediocre at best because then they will be perceived as racist for being honest. Let's keep it real. I leaned over to my wife and whispered every plot turn before it happened and believe me... I suck at predicting plot twists. I also don't think millennials have experienced truly stirring thrillers like What Lies Beneath or The Usual Suspects oreven Saw. Perhaps this is the best they have had so far. Come on over to my house for a thriller flick movie marathon millennials so I can show ya a thing or 1000 better than Get Out!
 Jeff T 	  I saw about 20 seconds of the trailer, and turned away after that because I already knew I wanted to see this move and didn't need to see any more spoilers in the trailer (and it has a LOT). Needless to say, I was more than thrilled with the movie and the many layers within it. Fantastic story, and great acting.
 S s 	  Fails as a comedy. Doesn't work as a horror film. Not even great from a thriller aspect. Completely overrated and waste of time.
 Ashley D 	  Great movie with phenomenal acting. A horror movie made for our time without the typical scary monsters and creatures. Just goes to show you, some of the realest monsters are people themselves. Great job on a movie well done.
 Kayla A 	  Great movie that nicely encompasses several genres. Definitely original and pretty thought provoking .
 Jerry P 	  One of the best movies I've seen in decades. Only mildly predictable, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Very few clich moments. Win-win.
 matt b 	  A truly unique horror entry. some aspects were predictable but it had me hooked until the end so i consider that a win.
 Noriko Francheska G 	  A complete mind fuck! So good! Will go see it again. Might pick up other things I missed. Mind Blown!
 Adam W 	  This movie was absolutely brilliant, beautifully? shot and directed.
 Rohini R 	  So thought provoking that my boyfriend and I had to break up after the movie. lmao
 Cameron H 	  Jordan Peele has it all: an effective premise, characters to care about, consistently funny dialogue, a strong underlying theme, and moments of extreme anxiety. Most horror films do not have that much going, so, for a first-time feature film, Get Out is especially impressive. Perhaps the horror itself is not too frightening upon full realization, but the presentation will be enough to give you the perspective of Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a black man about to visit his white girlfriend Rose's (Allison Williams) prestigious and even whiter family. Regarding the theme and premise, I do not feel fully comfortable in saying that Get Out offers Chris' full perspective. For Rose's family, it is not enough to welcome black people into their culture. They must literally be able to become black people. This film leaves quite an effective mark in contemporary American society, where many media outlets fail to integrate cultures in a respectful manner. Blatant white supremacy is a dying problem, but the secret supremacy lives on. That is what Rose's family represents, and we see Chris experiencing the extremities of feeling out of control, helpless to the strings of someone with more power, aggravated with how near impossible it seems to share compassion with the more privileged. Mainstream audiences are not often blessed with films like this. This is nice. Bonus points for an interracial sex scene (seriously, I cannot remember the last time I saw a black man and white woman have sex in a film that was not porn), as well as the comedic chops of Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, and LilRel Howery.
 Jessica H 	  I went into it thinking it would be over done, but there are a lot of details with great acting to pull it all together.
 Haiden C 	  A little gore, very much Comedy, and a movie that makes you yell "GET OUT!" to the screen! Very and highly entertaining!
 Gail C 	  No no no no no no no no no no... In the end (SPOILER ALERT) when Chris finds out he's been set up, and Rose, her parents and little brother are all killed, I found the audience's triumphant revelry, somewhat dsquieting. Why do people like a movie that exacerbates racial tensions between blacks & whites? Aren't we trying to heal from the past? If yes, then why pick at the wounds? Racism is offensive, no matter what color it comes in.
 Tommie M 	  Without a doubt the most well-written, nicely acted, scariest thriller-horror I have ever seen! I'm still thinking about this movie two weeks later and trying to figure how the director-writer pulled this off!!
 James D 	  A shocking film with a perfect combination of horror and comedy.
 Henry A 	  Get Put scared me so bad, I had to stand up on multiple occasions because I was in the midst of a panic attack. Completely unique take on a classic horror trope. Best film of the year so far.
 Debra M 	  I usually don't go to horror movies because they don't scare me, but this one had such a bizarre twist I found it entertaining. It's not your typical horror story, and has a nice blend of comedy and drama built into it. I didn't watch the trailer because I didn't want too much given away, so the plot was a thrilling surprise.
 Steven W 	  Great writing, deliberate pacing, thought-provoking. A great movie like this rarely comes out of Hollywood anymore.
 Joe S 	  Jordan peele pays respects to old school horror flicks this definitely worth seeing! felt like a kid again seeing a horror flick at cinema but I saw in multi plex but I miss that cinema feel and this help me with it !!!
 Salma A 	  Get Out is an incredibly written and directed movie and I was highly impressed when I watched it very recently. Honestly I wasn't expecting much as it was written and directed by a comedian but I have to say Jordan Peele has done an excellent job with this film. This movie is a horror flick but for me Get Out should be placed in its own special category. While most horror movies tend to frighten its viewers through jump scares, climax-rising music, and people walking down hallways, the scares from Get Out come from the mind using hypnosis, which is why I'd' list this as psychological horror. The movie centres around an African-American photographer named Chris as he and his caucasian girlfriend Rose head out of town to visit her parents. Chris is very intimidated as Rose's parents are oblivious to the fact that he is black. When they arrive, everything seems to go smooth as he realizes her parents are acting in a very peculiar and unsettling manner in a nervous attempt to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship. Gradually, he finds out disturbing discoveries that lead him to an unthinkable truth. Now I'm no movie-spoiler, but just a tip to really pay attention at the beginning of the movie. Like, don't even blink. You'll find out later. I realized that the whole point of the movie is to use horror and suspense as a tool to bring people more aware of modern-day stereotyping, nd I feel that Jordan Peele couln't have done that any better. There are unexpected twists, jump scares, and people walking down dark corridors that just add to the amazing horror experience. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and although it's only March I believe that this has got to be the top movie of the year.
 Marc A 	  Well acted, unnerving and funny...
 Luke W 	  Refreshing, opens your eyes, and a really well made Movie, not just a horror movie, its a f**king movie
 Kyle V 	  Horror and comedy. Not B-movie horror funny, but Jordan Peele funny AND great at delivering horror. But of course the best thing about it is how masterfully Peele crafted his commentary on racism in America. Will definitely be watching this one again to catch all the easter eggs
 Cameron R 	  Even if you are not a fan of horror this movie is still a must see, there's a reason why this movie has a 99% and it's well deserved.
 Michael D 	  Perfect example of how a great story still crushes millions of dollars in CGI any day! Congratulations to Jordan Peele on his first solo project. This film had it all, great story, acting, and the right amount of comedy (but not cheesy like most in this genre). I'm not a fan of horror films at all except for the classics (Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street) but this film doesn't exactly fit into one specific category. I've never seen a film like it. It didn't even need some crazy twist ending to make up for anything because the story was that simple and strong. If you're looking for something original that keeps your attention from start to finish, I highly recommend this film.
 Valerio P 	  Funny, clever, and .... exciting!!!!
 Hanna N 	  Definitely a MUST SEE-Peele does an EXCELLENT job of conveying racism into a psychotic perspective. Really makes me aware to the brutality of racism towards African Americans while also giving me the same excitement as any other horror movie. Be prepared to be scared!!
 Marlena D 	  One of the most incredibly fresh and rejuvenated thrillers of all time. The suspense and thrilling nature was coupled with comedy, and it felt harmonious. Topically relevant and beautifully executed, "Get Out" is an absolutely stellar directorial debut from comedian Jordan Peele.
 Kandis A 	  Great movie and great plot!!! I liked that it mixed several movie genres together!!!
 Michael M 	  99% fresh, with a SINGLE negative review? What the hell is wrong with you people? This movie was literally just "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" crossed with "The Stepford Wives", with all the meaningful social commentary of those two films removed. The comedy is hit or miss, the horror elements are nearly non-existent, and the film itself is just disappointingly unoriginal. None of that even begins to touch upon the central message/theme of the film, which is highly problematic at best, and deeply racist at worst. "Get Out" isn't a horrible film, but it is also not the modern masterpiece critics are hailing it to be. It's a shame, because with someone as staggeringly talented as Jordan Peele at the helm I expected so much more.
 David R 	  Good but not great movie. More of a suspense film rather than horror. The climax at the end doesn't really pay off, film becomes redundant and predictable. Had a ton of potential to go in a different and non predictable direction, but at the end of the day it is what it is. None of the movie makes any sense but it's not terrible.
 Jordan E 	  The plot was far fetched and made no sense. Was getting the sense that the director wanted the movie to be serious by the slow creepy music, but out of nowhere, a comedic character says something funny and everyone in the theater laughs. Huh? It was a lifetime movie with the occasional nickelodeon movie comedy. Very undeserving of the ridiculous tomatoes!!!
 Jake S 	  the whole movie was about how white people are racist. idk how this movie got 99% but thats a joke
 Larry M 	  This was a surprise and is exactly how the movie should begin and end mystery different
 King H 	  Really different and good to see something different
 Isaac C 	  it is a cool movie ,it was a little bit scary
 David G 	  Effective. Not only a fun thriller, but also fine film making. Thriller's have a unique ability to express social satire, and this one had some fun with that.
 KJ P 	  There are very few films each year that leave a lasting impact on its audience, but I can definitely see Get Out being one of the films remembered by the average moviegoing audience in 2017. When it comes to horror/thrillers I have been known to be turned off by most. I enjoy filmmaking in general as much as the next person, but the genre doesn't really do all that much for me, unless it's fantastic. To my surprise, this film is fantastic in many more ways than one. Shocking, disturbing, cringe-worthy (in a good way), and just downright smart, here is why I believe the audiences who only casually go to the cinemas will be calling Get Out one of their favourite films of the year. Racism has been a thing since the beginning of time. Nowadays, most of the world has accepted people as people and the division has vanished. That being said, there are still cases where stories like this can be extremely relevant. Now, take segregation and crank it up to a million. Then, and only then will you have Get Out. Following Chris as his girlfriend Rose takes him to meet her family for the first time, it begins as more of a romantic comedy. The tension starts when you see that he is a man of colour and she is not. Her entire family is Caucasian and clearly has something against his race. Using his race as slaves around their house, their behaviour seems off from the start. Seeming to be one big set-up for him, things begin to get uncomfortable at a rapid rate. If giving this film a perfect score meant it having an excessive amount of tension, then Get Out receives an A+ in my book. Made famous by his show Key & Peele, Jordan Peele writes and directs this film as his first effort out of the gate. If this film is any indication of his continuing talent, then this man has an even brighter future ahead of him than he already has now. Everything about the direction in this film is picture-perfect. From delivering a light tone with some very dark comedy throughout some very tense moments, to having the actors/actresses cry as they keep a straight face, there are so many elements that were probably extremely difficult to pull off here. I found myself in awe at how well this film was put together. For such a low budget and such a large box office return as of now, it just goes to show that people will see an original film after all. Although Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal of Chris is award-worthy in my humble opinion and the rest of the cast surrounding him gives it their all, making for an absolutely moving picture, my favourite actor in the film was easily LilRey Howrey. Portraying the best friend of Chris and the much needed comedic relief, his moments brought a sense of relief in an otherwise tension-filled film. From tears to death, this film isn't afraid to go all out, so it was very nice to see that a comedian (Peele) could bring a sense of humanity to his script in a film that is not supposed to be taken too seriously. There are many laughs to be had, many jumps, and a few great twists, but the best portion of this film is the fact that it's not afraid to balance it all with a bit of levity. In the end, Get Out is the type of film that escalates so much by the time that it reaches the third act, making it impossible to not stir up a conversation between its viewers. For all viewers who can accept a bit of an overblown finale, this film will definitely make people talk. For that reason alone, along with the fact that it's cleverly written, well-acted, and very well-directed, Get Out will be able to impress horror fans, fans of tension, fans of a great story, and fans who just love to see a film stay consistently great and surprising throughout. The screening I attended has people applauding at certain moments and I can't see audiences dying down anytime soon. This film is making bank and there is a good reason for that. From beginning to end, Get Out is incredibly impressive. There are a few unexplained things that I wish had a bit more detail, but in the scheme of things, it's just a speeding ticket. I love Get Out and it's one of the best of this young year so far.
 Stuart A 	  Wow!! Amazing! What a great combination of comedy and thriller. One of the more original pieces of media I have seen in a long time. Jordan Peele is showing his versatility and I hope he continues to branch into the film industry, full force.
 Yunyu C 	  Really good one! You have to watch it! And every detail is count
 Becky F 	  4.5/5 stars. Go see.
 Krysi F 	  Read another for a synopsis. I enjoyed this movie so much i created an acct here to say GO WATCH THIS MOVIE
 Meg T 	  My only complaint is that some footage in the trailer was not in the actual movie.
 James R 	  Great thrill ride into a thought provoking satire that makes you think about scenes and have aha moments after you left the movies.
 Maya S 	  The social commentary is hidden right under the layer and it is very cleverly done. It is a well written, well acted, well executed movie with so much to offer both in the cheap and the the deep thrill departments. Don't miss it.
 Micah and Sarah F 	  too much racism being played upon.....so weird.....and way too much cursing
 Andrea D 	  A well written, well directed psychological thriller ???
 Andrew B 	  It doesn't really work as a horror movie, and the climax could've have been just a bit more connected with the rest of the movie, but it's originality and openly weird and atonal thriller/comedy mashup style still make it an entertaining social satire.
 Andrew R 	  Just two words could sum up this film: Stepford Wives
 Christine M 	  I loved the movie! I also liked the Easter eggs through out the movie. They explain a deeper meaning of events.
 Alexander K 	  Better than Moon Light.
 Jake P 	  One of the best thrillers I've seen In a long time. But can I call it a thriller cause there's comedy in it too. The plot is original and damn right messed up and twisted. Loved it from start to finish!
 Wade G 	  Very good psychological thriller. Very much in the vein of The Twilight Zone. Some may find the overt racial overtones uncomfortable but it is so well acted and it's an enjoyable, thrilling story.
 Ryan N 	  Well done Mr. Peele. I'm looking forward to your future projects with great enthusiasm.
 Nick K 	  Great suspense...interesting concept.
 Jobey A 	  Was made very well, but the hype didn't live up to itself. I got a lot Skeleton Key vibes very early on.
 brad c 	  The reviews of this movie are not a reflection of the movie. They are a reflection of a white, liberal elite who feel compelled to give the movie glowing reviews to prove their politically-correct bona fides. The movie isn't bad but it in no way deserves these stratospheric reviews.
 Juliana S 	  Best horror movie since The Shining, IMO, and there are homages to that classic sprinkled throughout.
 Brian O 	  While the storyline is ultimately a familiar one, the perspective is fresh which made it way more interesting than it should be. Which is a great thing. So unique is the perspective, this could be considered "Jaws" for the African American community. The bigotry comes off painfully honest and the distrust of whites is palpable. A can't miss horror movie the cuts to the core and delivers comedy to cut the high tension that is excellently built up.
 Chlo G 	  Best movie I've ever seen
 Lee D 	  This movie was crazy, silly, stupid, and great! Very intriguing and surprising. I want to see it again!
 Ray M 	  Excellent! Funny, scary, well done. This movie will make you uncomfortable and leave you frazzled.
 Clive R 	  Great movie by Peele. In his directorial debut Peele creates a movie that will leave a lasting impression to those keen to understand the social dynamic that plays as the undercurrent in this horror movie. To those uninitiated will sadly dismiss this movie as race bait or unoriginal. The rotten tomatoes score speaks for itself.
 Pam D 	  I was reluctant to see because I am not a horror movie fan, but there is enough humor and subtle winks to the audience to make this really fun.
 Andrew K 	  One of the best horror/suspense films I've ever seen. Reminded me of my first time watching "The Shining".
 Nicole H 	  I wish I could get this time back, and my money back. Supposedly a great scary horror film?? Nope. DO NOT waste your time if you want to watch a scary film. Bored 98% of the time. Laughed about twice and that's the best I can say. Please dear God drop the rating on this film so no one else wastes their money and precious time on this film. I'd rather watch paint dry that ever see this again.
 Amy D 	  A crowd pleaser but also thought provoking.
 B b 	  Lol cheap ass movie.
 B b 	  Lol cheap ass movie.
 Dom F 	  Best horror in years!
 Robertson R 	  Fantastic debut for Jordan Peele as a director and I hope he continues to make films at this caliber for a long time.
 Jackson L 	  i made it 35 minutes before I walked out of the theater. This movie is so uninteresting, dull, and crawls at a turtle's pace. When is something going to happen that makes me want to keep watching? ....agonizing!
 Daryl C 	  Allright. This movie has been getting rave reviews, so I had to see it. And it was decent. Much better than most thriller movies of recent (although Split was quite good imo). Why 3 stars? Because if you saw the trailer...you've pretty much seen the tense moments, and know where the movie is going to go. If I had never seen the preview, I would have enjoyed this movie immensely, but the trailer just straight ruined the movie. Then, once you get passed the areas of the movie that were spoiled by the trailer, the movie telegraphs too often. Let the audience be shocked and confused instead of letting us know a reveal before the surprise. Positives. There was a moment I completely felt the intense dread, and uncertainty in a situation, and felt the protagonist's situation in my gut....great scene. Even though the movie delves heavily into race, it deals mainly in interracial awkwardness rather than out and out racism. I think it handled the race portion well, which reading the negative reviews seems to be where the dislike came from many. Decent movie, not a 99% in my opinion, but worth a watch, and if possible avoid the preview.
 Gabby M 	  Get Out is one of the most interesting movies I have seen. Though about halfway through the movie one realizes what it goes on, the actual "twist" has a bigger twist that I did not see coming. The acting is wonderful and it is very easy to get engaged in the lives of the characters, especially the protagonist. It has a little feeling of "Rosemary's Baby" when it comes to the idea of a group against someone who has no clue what it really going on, so the mystery is great!
 Chloe' B 	  Excellent movie! I was skeptical at first but it had some of each genre in it and turned out to be a really good nail bitter.
 Marsha R 	  Scary well done story . Funny at times but focused on the story. Loved it , I haven't watched a proper thriller in years.
 David S 	  Incredibly entertaining and very well done, especially considering the cast is almost entirely unknown. Funny, witty, suspenseful, unique -- it's got it all.
 Pooja P 	  The "comedy" in this movie was too obvious and tacky. The racism that they wanted us to see through several little moments (the police incident, the awkward party, the obama comment) didn't feel deep, just superficial in "trying too hard" manner. As I watched the movie I kept feeling like, "yes, I know what you're talking about and where you're going with this,but I don't find it touching and sincere, in any way. Are you just shoving scenarios onto my face, that you've been dying to see in a movie yourself?" All through the movie I kept waiting for the crux; the show-stopping moment, be in the form of tragic comedy, tragedy or even wit alone, just something that evoked a visceral feeling that I would take home with me. Just something that would make me feel like, Yes! Finally, the movie has begun. Sadly, that moment never came for me. It looked like Peele, through this movie was trying to convey too many things, doing justice to none, really. The horror element was there, just not enough. The racial element was there, just not enough. The comedy was there, again, just not enough. I ended up leaving the movies feeling immensely dissatisfied. In my opinion, at best, this movie was a decent episode of what could be a pretty good TV show.
 Paul D 	  Unapologetic race bating film. If the same was made about a white man dating a black woman, no way would it be getting this same kind of press and praise. I can sum up this movie in three words: "Fuck white people."
 John M 	  White people at their craziest. So this is about a young African-American man (Daniel Kaluuya) who meets the family of his Caucasian girlfriend (Allison Williams) for the first time. They've got money for days, so who really knows what they are up to behind closed doors of their secluded estate? As you may or may not already know, this is from Jordan Peele, who makes up half of the comedy duo Key and Peele. He writes and directs here, but he also wrote the misfire Keanu, so I had mixed expectations for this... that is, before all of the overwhelming positive word of mouth and glowing reviews started to roll in. He has put together one of the smartest horror movies of the decade in Get Out, so I give him a major tip of my hat. With race relations being the way that they are in this country, not only is this movie welcome, it's actually needed, and it makes social commentary for days. Jordan Peele has also gone on the record and said that this is a movie that is designed to be seen in a theater, and if you wait for the home market, you're missing out on a large part of the intended experience. Obviously, this is his baby, so he knows what he is talking about, but I had such a great time watching this in a theater filled with an audience of different ethnicities, I absolutely agree with him. You know the stereotype of someone that talks at the horror movie and interacts with the person sitting next to him/her? Someone that would yell at the screen for the protagonist to... well, get out? This movie has an actual character that does that for you. The best friend character (LilRel Howery) who is present almost entirely via cell phone always says the exact thought that is on the entire audience's mind, and it is like Jordan Peele is actively speaking to the audience and breaking the fourth wall. It is a very nice embellishment on a film that is filled with smart decisions. Something that you should know about me is that I love a movie that will make me feel so awkward that I can barely stand to stay in my seat. Get Out made me squirm in the best way possible. It plays on stereotypes, and with the featured conversation topics that are chosen to be had between the people of different skin colors, it allows this movie to have a foot in the door of reality in what is very much a genre film. The story itself is a mystery, and I do recommend knowing as little as possible walking into this. It's also a horror movie where your protagonist does not make bone-headed decisions, which is something that is all too rare within the genre. It's hilarious, it's intelligent, and it is rare that we get a movie that is this good in the first quarter of the year.
 Ryan C 	  With dark humor and chilling twists, "Get Out" is a successfully suspenseful film about a black man meeting his white girlfriend's parents on a weekend getaway from Hell. Writer/director Jordan Peele manages to balance the racial issues with the thought-provoking actions of it characters just right to give the audience a nice amount of jolts and chills.
 Trisha D 	  This movie is thought-provoking, thrilling, and well-executed. I connected with the main characters and believed that this is something that could actually happen in real life. I would recommend this movie to family and friends without hesitation.
 Cynthia S 	  The main thing that I enjoyed about the movie besides the acting and storyline was the directing. The movie flowed very well. I might have thought that him realizing his girlfriend was in on it happened kind of quickly but I have a low attention span so it worked well for me.
 christina h 	  It was a good movie. Had me jumping but it was good.
 Phillip C 	  This movie was flawless. Clear understanding very easy to follow and creepy as sh!t. I love this movie!!!
 shereen r 	  Well written story line paired with suberb acting! A must watch
 Keith M 	  I was the one sitting in the front row of the cinema in New York for the opening of "A Clockwork Orange". So I can deal with a little violence mixed in with social commentary and a twist of horror.My impression of "Get Out" is that it's the "in" movie for people to watch for some of the same reasons. However, "Get Out" lacks artistry and purpose. The movie does an adequate job of making fun of racial/cultural stereotypes, but again, the underlying plot is pathetic. Save your money.
 Quintin E 	  In a time where we have a scary government and racism is hidden... this movie sheds light and makes you think twice about trusting overly nice strangers... a comedy horror done right.
 Nicholas G 	  Great film. Very thought provoking, hilarious, and great twist I would give it 6 stars if I could
 Neon V 	  This movie was not entertaining at all. The story was not engaging, the characters were bland, the theme would have been better presented in better hands. The actors themselves were standard quality, not bad, not great either, just okay. Cinematography has that, it might rain but never does aesthetic throughout the movie. Not scary, not funny, narrative boring. Overall, bad.
 Molly C 	  Suspenseful with twists and surprises, humor popping up at just the right time. Cast was great!
 Mark C 	  Refreshing first and second acts, only to the brought down by the surprisingly derivative third act.
 Ryan P 	  It'll make you jump, cringe, laugh and reflect. I also no longer have a celebrity crush on Allison Williams.
 Joe M 	  long and not a very good movie
 Rocco B 	  Bad movie, boring not interesting fake suspense movie.
 Norberto F 	  different. nice first outing from an unique voice in the horror suspense genre.
 Collin S 	  It had a very compelling story, and the violence wasn't out of place in this highly reviewed thriller. The only catch was that it was really strange and hard to comprehend at some points.
 Linda M 	  "I mean I told you not to go in the hour."
 John%20 C 	  Extremely overated. Playing on the racial tensions of our time. People seem to be afraid to give true criticism to an aspiring young black director who I believe has a bright future if he decides to create actual movies instead of this attention grabbing trash.
 John W 	  Not Impressed.Racist and Stupid.Add the plot has been done before many times over in a hundred ways. If you saw the trailer you saw the whole movie.
 Jay F 	  Updated Hitchcock style.
 Woachie D 	  Both for the horror fan and horror shy alike, Get Out was funny and smart, with a couple of decent jump-scares and overall food for thought.
 Michael F 	  Really good movie and a little comedy, enjoyed it would recommend
 Rodney P 	  One of the most original and unique movies I've seen in recent memory. Great cast and acting. Not really a horror movie though, more of a suspenseful thriller.
 Lee M 	  What makes Get Out more than just a slam-bang scarefest is that, in its own darkly satiric way, it is also a movie about racial paranoia that captures the zeitgeist in ways that many more "prestigious" movies don't.
 Mark T 	  Amazing movie from start to finish. I watched a lot of movies in my time and the whole time watching this movie I was on the edge of my seat. MUST WATCH!
 Ron C 	  Simply amazing. Perfectly horror genre but do much more.
 Yusuf V 	  magnificent...truly one of a kind movie in a time when we needed in this society. funny and horror mix like never seen before
 Lori A 	  The movie was really good
 Caleb H 	  3.5/5For those of us who are horror/thriller enthusiasts, do not be mislead by the rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. We have seen this tale before, and while "Get Out" is a fresh spin with a few tricks up its sleeve it is not 'revolutionary'. In fact, "Get Out's"' best moments are the ones where it keeps you guessing and making you uncomfortable with its social observations. Once the mystery is solved about 3/4 of the way through, however, its legs fall out from under it #GetOutChallengeFail. If the film spent more of its beginning developing the compelling lead, Chris, the latter half of the journey could have had far more of an emotional resonance and not so much of an "us v.s. them" vibe.
 Jon G 	  Awesome, new idea. Great soundtrack, great acting. Definitely a must-see. It re-defines the genre of thriller.
 Cristian B 	  Though the movie falters a bit in the last third, this is a solid and promising directorial debut for Peele. The movie is an entertaining mix of horror and comedy, laced with social commentary about race relations. It also benefits from a talented cast, who all do strong work. This is funny, thought-provoking and unsettling stuff.
 Ryan M 	  I don't know what everyone else sees in this. It was ok. Definitely had some funny moments and some clever social commentary, but overall wasn't something I'd want to watch again. Not to mention that the explanations for the "weird" things was too much of a stretch for my taste.
 Omar L 	  Like "1984," the first two-thirds of the story are setup for an exciting third act where the violence feels completely justified. Bigotry isn't really explored in "Get Out;" that doesn't really resonate well with audiences today. No, it's a more casual form of racism that's shown here. It's the self-congratulatory condescending over-jovial overcompensating type of racism that ostensibly comes from a charitable place. It's the type of racism exemplified by liberal whites who read Ta-Nahisi Coates, think they know about the black experience, may even have black friends, but have no idea what really occurs. But that's just the setup to a remarkable third act in which the audience is actively on the side of a young, dark-skinned Black man who has to kill the white affluent men and women around him in order to survive.
 Mary T 	  Not a horror fan, so shouldn't have gone to see it in the first place.
 Marla S 	  One of the worst movies I have ever seen
 Paul M 	  Very thoughtful and funny.
 Jaysen S 	  Get Out review:Time to Get this review Out the way. So for those who do not know, Get Out is about a guy named Chris who is going to meet the parents of his girlfriend, Rose. This review is hard to do without spoiling the meaning of a lot of scenes, so I am going to mention a few. First off, almost every scene in this movie serves a purpose, especially the beginning scene where a African American man is getting captured and then you hear the song Stay Woke playing in the background. Like in our society, something bad happens to a African American and nobody talks about it, then when it is brought to the attention of authority figures, they laugh about it, as a way of symbolizing in our world of people ignoring these issues. Not going to go into the lyrics in the song Stay Woke, but pay attention to them and they will make sense as the movie progresses.Many people may think this film is racist or anti white, but that is not the case. This people shows passive racism in a way that if you remove people who are black or white with people of a different skin color that the same situation could potentially happen. For example, all because the dad in the movie said he would have voted for Obama for a third term does not mean he is not racist. There is also a scene where the girlfriend is drink white milk in a black straw with colored cereal, which shows the separation of the colors and the whites. Constantly asking the main character what sport he is good at or how his performance is just shows that those type of comments can make someone who is a minority in society feel uncomfortable. At the party scene, the main character is the only one wearing blue while everyone else is wearing red, representing societal power dominance. The fact the idea of color blindness was used in such a non-conventional way in a movie like this helped expand the parallels in this movie.The performances in this movie are outstanding, especially since some people are playing a different character in the same body. All I can say without spoiling that aspect. Chris gave an outstanding performance and his character was written so well that he was not close to being portrayed as a "black" stereotype. The actor who played his friend was hilarious and helped ease some of that uneasy tension from the movie while not distracting from the films purpose. The only problem I had with the movie is that it did not explore of biases that exist for African Americans through the interactions at the party scene. They kinda did, but it felt rushed just to help increase tension. The small comments, objects in the back and foreground that represent the prejudice that still invades our society today shows how important and amazing this movie is. On the surface, this movie is a thriller, but if you break down the themes in the film then this movie can be viewed as a horror movie, due to how some people can experiences these awkward situations. Highly recommend this movie to those who have not scene it and I give this movie an A.Funny comment I heard someone say in the theater: eat my timbs
 Julius G 	  Not your usual horror, suspense film which I think many will appreciate. Congrats to J. Peele for excellent writing and directing.
 Chris J 	  Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
 Jose D 	  A decent movie with a with mix of good mystery and suspense in the 2/3 of the film. Too bad it has a stupid twist. 3 stars
 Gloria U 	  I gave it such low stars because it's almost exactly the same as the Alfred Hitchcock movie I don't understand what all the hype is about if it's a remake fine but they're not calling it a remake just because you change a little bit here and there doesn't mean that it's an original film
 Darmon S 	  I've been drinking, while I watched this movie (TMI? Probably). I've also read the reviews from people after watching it. Are these commentators, paid reviewers? If they are, you are wasting your money. All of their reviews, sound the same. "OMG, this is a racially charged movie that the left or the liberals, immitiate, how they use blacks.." Yadda yadda yadda. Only simple people get stimulated from your typical statements. I will not proclaim that I am a "Horror" movie addict. However, from the usual hack and slash (BTW, gore is not horror). I enjoyed the movie because it was a different speed. No more Chewbacca height, seemingly immortal, white slasher chasing down teenagers for no real reason at all, except for showing up and having sex or drinking. No no no. Even though the storyline wasn't flawless, what was great about it, was that it was unique. Family abducts people, to sell to the highest bidder, in the hopes of using their body for immortality. Bravo Jordan Peele. My only interest is what happened to Chris after the whole ordeal. Then again, the details are usually left out of movies, so that the viewers, have something either to look forward to or to keep them guessing. I take my hat off to you.
 Kevin M. W 	  A weekend getaway to meet the new girlfriend's parents is a horrific consideration for most guys in any case, but Jordan Peele's debut squeezes this chestnut as if it were a whole nuther nut altogether. While not worth the 100 it's getting this is still a decent thrill ride with paranoia whispering in you ear throughout.
 Cristian R 	  I heard a lot of good things about this movie and when I went to go watch it at the theaters I was not disappointed. A great movie with some humor and kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.
 Anthony M 	  Great movie. I really enjoyed myself.
 Jon O 	  If you're not a fan of horror but want to show the ladies you're not a wuss, take her to this one to show your manhood. There are scary parts but it's more on the thriller side. Great movie nonetheless.
 Todd N 	  The film has twists in it, some hit and some don't, and the trailer does reveal a fair amount of the film, yet when you watch it it all feels so fresh and new. Peele makes an amazing debut as writer and director (writing for Keanu aside) and the film pulls you into a world that is blatantly nonsensical yet is still grounded in real world issues
 Fabian N 	  Great movie, turns society problems to a horror movie. Our mindset needs to change for a better society.
 Jax G 	  Nice to see a film where blacks are useful
 Ash H 	  Lost for words ! Brilliant movie
 Sam M 	  Thought provoking movie, however it was predictable from the first few minutes. If a "thriller" is predictable from the start it has failed in my book.
 Monica H 	  Such a great movie! Super suspenseful but funny too
 Sean A 	  I had to sign up just to rate this as the professional critics are just dumb. This movie was obvious in everything it was going to say. You knew who everyone was 10 minutes in. It's clich and racist, (spoiler, every white person is bad. Every black is good) The acting is the best part. The dialogue is good and makes you feel uncomfortable... at first. After 20 minutes the whole movie seems forced to hammer a point into your head. It's not a terrible movie. It's a cheesy horror movie slanted against whites. If you are ultra liberal, you'll love it. Conservative, you'll hate it. Neither like me, you'll see it for what it is, a half decent waste of time. I expected more from Peele. I love Key & Peele, even when they call out whites on their stuff.
 Alina G 	  That was freaking fantastic.
 Yuming Z 	  Worst movie I have ever seen. Boring and ridiculous
 Joshua L 	  This was a cleverly handled concept but that doesn't make it a good movie. It was OK.
 khajak a 	  I have no idea why this movie is getting great reviews ...me and my wife predicted every scene ...i thought it was a horror movie satire half way through the movie we laughed at how stupid it was more than anything ...to the director peele....stick to comedy ...actually stick to comedy that doesn't have those wierd creeping ackward moments
 Amilcar A 	  Phenomenal find. I did not expect this to be any good and it turned out to be one of the scariest and funniest movies i have seen in a very long time. It's absurd and insane so you get a lot of great laughs but there's plenty of scary weirdness to go around.
 Chris F 	  Scam. Cheapy home made movie. waste of money. better that you and see 100 million dollar movies like Kong or Logan verse giving you money to this cheap movie. Not even worth seeing online.
 Jessica R 	  absolutely loved it! jumped out of my seat on a few occasions
 Craig O 	  The story was too similar to another movie I saw about 10 years ago which made it extremely predictable. I probably would have given it 4 stars if I hadn't "seen the movie before". I was originally reluctant to buy tickets for this movie, because the previews made it look like Hollywood hammering on racial buttons. There was a little bit of that, but it wasn't enough to bother me. The racism worked well with the story. The main black character was very likable. He responded to racism like he was thinking "they probably don't know how racially ignorant they are, but it's okay, it doesn't bother me. I'm above it". It was really well acted. It felt like genuine responses.
 Lanry H 	  I have watched it yesterday and this movie is awesome! But this movie also reminds me one movie called 'The Skeleton Key',and I don't know if it just a coincidence
 Trina B 	  Incredible film. A must see!
 jasmine K 	  This movie was great!! It was like seeing the inside of a black man head when put in that situation where you are the only black person around a bunch of white people. It was funny, suspenseful and some parts scary. I love the subject matter it was insightful and fresh. Well done!
 Jenn B 	  W.t.f stepford wives feels
 Joshua F 	  Suspenseful horror, funny, social commentary,
 Steve G 	  Ungrateful uppity. So this is how it feels to be a black man in a Dem home.I hate when films are this self-aware. The girl is insufferable. No wonder. Just found out who her father is (Brian Williams). Was interesting enough, but really ended with no justifiable purpose, which every movie needs. Racial thing had no rhyme or reason. Just forced. Really stupid (as most horror is), but decent. It had its moments. 99% rating is way overstating it.
 Joshua S 	  Movie holds your attention and offers a twist at the end that is hiding in plain sight! Although I felt at times certain scenes were pretentious, it was a win for Mr. Peele on his first film as a director.
 Sidney L 	  A refreshing breath of air in the horror genre. I really had no idea what the turn was going to be, but man did it pay off great! The greatest thing about this film is that the scares aren't cheap. It's frightening because frankly if you put yourself in the main character's shoes, he's making the choices that I would want him to make as opposed to often feeling like the main character is making a deliberately dumb decision. Go see this movie!!
 Jean S 	  Hate scary movies but went because of Jordan Peele. Absolutely LOVED this movie. Five stars ALL THE WAY
 Cheri L 	  I hate horror movies! This was awesome!
 Raihan K 	  Keeps the audience in suspense till the end of the movie.
 Greg C 	  I must admit, horror movies are not my thing. Given that, I find Get Out is not one to be pigeon holed into a box. I don't know what to think. It might be trying to say something about race in America. Is the message to people of color, "Get Out", as in save yourselves. Let me acknowledge that there is a twist and things get weird. Anyone who sees any trailer can tell that. The whole is not K&P funny, nor all that scary. It might be another of the 'Jordan Peele gets high and writes a script' movies (like Keanu). The more I think about it, the worse I think of this one. So, I am going to stop now.
 April S 	  This was so good! Not what I expected at all!
 chris r 	  it is light laughs, heavy themes and good tension.
 Chelsea R 	  Hilariously fresh take on everyday racism amongst the affluent white communities.
 Michael C 	  What a CHEAPLY made movie. I could afford to make this film. This movie is a scam. How the hell did this get in theaters?I can't believe people waste their money on HOME MADE movie.
 Grant L 	  I have a new found respect for TSA agents. That being said I have never flown.
 Emily G 	  It is not a deep and profound movie, people are making it one and want it to be. Movie was just OK.
 NintendoJackson . 	  So good on the edge of your seat the whole movie and you can't stop thinking about what's going to happen next I highly suggest this movie to everyone who is looking for a good happy ending and a good thriller
 Kirk b 	  This was one of the worst movies I e ever seen. Open Water had more of a point. Totally predictable. Save your money.
 Rogelio G 	  Awfully predictable and over hyped. I feel as though it gets these ratings because of the racial aspect of it but we should remember it's supposed to be a horror movie. With that said, it's a fairly terrible one.
 Christina M 	  Yes!!! I finally made it to theaters to see this!! I really enjoyed it! Of course I was again expecting a lot bc the trailer is awesome and the reviews so far are awesome, so I was left a little disappointed at the twist. But all in all it was a great suspenseful watch and I would watch it again. ***All of my squeamish friends will enjoy it, you can safely say it's suspenseful rather than scary, it'll keep you on the edge of your seat without terrifying you.
 Chad C 	  This is a great movie - it's funny, scary and thought-provoking. It's a bummer that so many people give it poor reviews - almost always noting that it's a good film but they won't give it good marks because it's some secret liberal Obama plot agains the white man. The movie plays on the (well-founded?) fear of that some black people might have about white, rural America. Geez, how rude! I'm glad there are no movies in which white people's fears of inner-city black people play out. Remember Chevy Chase in "Vacation", where in one gag he leads his family off the beaten path and into the "ghetto", where he has to pull over to ask directions and hilarity ensues? (He's robbed of his money and hub caps). Remember "Animal House", where a bunch of white college boys take their ill-gotten dates to an all-black bar? The overwhelming discomfort and fear made me us all laugh our ___'s off. Those are just the ones that popped into my head immediately. Get over it white America - you'd be nervous about being dropped off in Compton in the middle of the night (perhaps rightfully so, depending on who you ran into) and that fear has been played out in movies of all genres for decades. An inner-city black guy might have underlying fears about being dropped off in all-white rural America (perhaps rightfully so, depending on who he ran into). It's no different - as with all satire, there is just enough truth to make it interesting.
 Jarrad L 	  Going in my horror movie collection as soon as I can buy it.
 Daniel M 	  "Reverse" racism is now in movie form. Equality right?
 Eileen V 	  While I'm not generally keen on horror or thriller films, Get Out is a fascinating commentary on race relations today.
 John M 	  fan of K&P but this movie is over hyped. It's more like a straight to dvd/on demand type movie, not bad but not deserving of the level of praise it's getting. A hacky concept with a mediocre execution. Peele is obviously talented but this ain't classic, too precious.
 Lenard W 	  Meeting your bae's parents is a scary experience. It can be even scarier if you are a different color and the hometown is lily white. But there is nothing to fear, is there? The parents and sibling may try a little too hard to reassure you they are fine with your race. The other black people may act a little weird, like they were brainwashed. But the terror you feel is allin your head. Maybe you just need a therapist to hypnotize you to overcome that fear.The performances are great, especially Bradley Whitford and Allison Williams. Watch it a second time and you may catch the subtle irony. And blacks finally may understand why white people don't just get out of that house.
 Facebook U 	  Despite some occasional pacing issues during the first hour, this satirical sci-fi thriller described as "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" meets "The Stepford Wives" delivers hefty laughs, ample suspense and biting social commentary that might make even the most self-avowed open-minded viewers squirm. Writer-director Jordan Peele hits a home run in his debut feature, making a mark that one can only hope is a sign of things to come. Those who enjoy thought-provoking cinema with unexpected plot twists are sure to like just about everything this release has to offer.
 Christina A 	  That was pretty good! Reminded me a lot of Skeleton Key. But this movie had a lot of racial/racist slurs....you gotta wonder about the people who come up with these stories for movies like this. There's some crazy people out here.
 Beyonka D 	  White guilt is the ONLY reason why people are rating this movie so high. Awful acting. Awful dialogue. Didn't get scared not once. Horrible movie. This is a slap in the face for people who actually appreciate a good movie. Take a piece from Quintin Tarantino Mr. Peele. Ugh. This is an outrage. It's amazing what our world has come to.
 Collin B 	  Not as scary as I thought but well written and clever from start to finish.
 Edgar F 	  This was the best one yet.
 Stephanie E 	  Interesting and original.
 Marco Y 	  Probably the greatest movie of 2017
 rob b 	  Clever, funny, and an impressive effort by Jordan Peele.
 David W 	  Jordan Peele really knocked it out of the park with this one on every level. It's scary, tense, funny, socially relevant and perfectly paced. I'm looking forward to more movies from him.
 jol m 	  This movie was amazing, it had me in suspense one moment and laughing hysterically the next. Many twists and turns and hidden symbolism throughout. It's crazy
 IsH G 	  SAW THE MOVIE 3 TIMES IN THE THEATER!!!! BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!
 Poppa 1 	  Only Armond White of the National Review spotted Peele's dim-witted and vicious ploys in this hackneyed waste of good celluloid. Peele is just another knuckle-dragging hoaxster cut from the shabby Black Live Matter mould. Beneath his sly attempts at skewering racial tropes is a steady drumbeat of old and tired (and vastly out-dated) mewlings of the Victim Class.
 Nick F 	  I feel duped by all the great reviews. I've never been more disappointed in a movie than with this one. Nobody in the movie acts like a real human being, everybody is in a trance-like state which makes it unwatchable from the get-go. {SPOILERS AHEAD}: Then we have brain surgery going on in a basement by 1 guy without ancillary staff and the patients aren't even intubated?! The girl is unattractive yet can get any top black athlete she wants? A camera flash changes people's behavior for 60 seconds? It's not even a horror movie- it's suspenseful if anything with a few people getting killed in the last 5 minutes of the movie.
 April W 	  This movie right here is an old fashioned psychological horror movie without the gore. This movie reminds me of the 70's style movies that play on your worst fears but in a very realistic way.
 Steve M 	  Thought it was a bit freaky but ridiculous at the same time. Not for me
 Cherelle B 	  "Get Out" is a must see! The first 10 min of the movie will have you glued to your seat because every word and/or detail is so captivating. This movie has a way of grabbing its audience with comedy, frightening scenes, and messages that leave you pondering. This is movie earned 5 stars for a reason. Don't let other people tell you how the movie is. Go see it for yourself....
 Cele S 	  Finally, a movie that draws upon the most horrific nightmares of people-of-color that humanizes the realities of racism in modern times. The cast is impeccable, the screenplay is novel-worthy, the cinematography is cuttingly beautiful, and the direction is unnerving. I am going to try to see this at least a few more times in the coming weeks. Feelin hella empowered after watchin this ish.
 Austin A 	  Great for a few laughs. Easily predictable throughout the whole movie.
 La'Shauna S 	  Definitely lived up to the hype.
 Patrick J 	  First, let me say I really enjoyed the movie. I would add that my perspective makes it difficult for me to unpack or fully understand all the social commentary and things going on here - I leave that to all the folks smarter than me, and I hope to learn more about that.
 Brick%20 W 	  Easily predictable and definitely not scary.
 Nico Y 	  Definently a go and see
 June W 	  Loved it from start to finish! Saw it twice in theaters and the audience applause was amazing!
 Kurt M 	  Horrible. Not funny or suspenseful. Waste of time and money.
 Ronnie R 	  Awesome, different, must see, they all die!
 Harrison W 	  Genuinely shocking throughout. Glad there was humor to breakup the bleakness. The acting was phenomenal. Couldn't help but see the parallels to The World's End--this did a lot better but some worse. The wink during the exposition was hilarious.
 Tyler H 	  Far from a horror classic and definitely overrated. More of a political film than an artistic one. Some cheesy scares and a few good laughs doesn't really do it for me. The originality of the story and the above-average acting really bumps the rating up for me but a predictable plot leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
 sami y 	  This was a really really good movie. It'll make you yell, clap, say "That's fucked up"... it will make you run the whole gamut of human emotion. A very almost classy amount of violence and an actually sound plot along with excellent acting and a little humor. Go see it.
 Sajag A 	  Never reviewed a movie in my life. Crazy controversial, but great movie. It definitely deserves its 99% rating.
 Alejandro M 	  Must see movie.....great surprise!!!
 Lewis Y 	  Wow a very well done and unique movie! Jordan Peele on his way to movie greatness ha!
 Ti C 	  Great movie! Definitely will watch again!!
 Jeremy D 	  Absolutely incredible
 Gabriel W 	  In all honesty a top 10 movie of all time, beautifully directed. Great acting to create a thriller with a laugh. A must watch.
 Hannah M 	  It was funny and horrifying. It brings forward cringeworthy social aspects of today's "diet racism". It provides a good, satisfying close. Altogether I loved this movie and what it represents.
 Daren B 	  Get out to see "Get Out"!!! This movie would make the master; Alfred Hitchcock proud. No SFX or CGI just good old fashioned storytelling.
 Jason S 	  Does not live up to the hype or it's amazing trailer. Set up is well done but third act fizzles into b-movie sci-fi mediocrity. Feels like a lot of potential was wasted, overall good but definitely not great.
 Scott B 	  One of the best things about this movie is that many of the events and touches in the beginning and middle take on a whole new meaning once the truth comes out. Thinking of how Rose handled the police officer on the road, in particular, but there are many others. Looking forward to watching this again at some point to see what was missed the first time.
 Will B 	  The worst movie I have ever seenI had to leave after an hour
 Phil M 	  Excellent movie. Thrilling, scary and funny somehow.
 Eddie H 	  Wow! What a crazy movie
 Allen H 	  Judging by how many racists it's managed to anger, it must be amazing.
 Angela N 	  Such a great and thought provoking film. Best of 2017!
 Sam S 	  excellent comedy and horror.
 Lance B 	  Bizarre but yet somewhat predictable
 Je B 	  Best movie about race. Smartest movie out there
 Adam G 	  This movie had a ton of potential with an interesting plot. The first half of the movie was great. However, I absolutely hated how race was added throughout the second half of the movie. To me, this was tasteless and completely not necessary. Ruined the movie for me.
 Tomas G 	  Great acting. Great execution. Great comedic relief.
 Mary T 	  This movie was a work of art! Kudos to the creator for bring brave enough to produce something so truthful and still entertain at the same time. There are multiple layers within the narrative to discuss. The genius of this movie is that it couldn't have been more timely! I've seen it twice now. The atmosphere at the theater was electrifying!
 Adam H 	  interesting but predictable.
 Daniel V 	  Just see it. No, no. Don't read any more. Just see it.
 Kimberly S 	  Finally a smart and horrifying film on so many levels....
 Susan J 	  Very well written very well done. You will be questioning so many things about your own perceptions about race, racism and discriminatory practices after seeing this. It's an eye opener. "Becky" is alive and well portrayed!
 John S 	  Very good suspenseful action movie, it well keep you aon edge of your seats.
 Yo J 	  Just saw this movie, it was suspenseful and very well done.
 Mike H 	  Worst movie I have seen this year. Don't waist your money. How in the world it got those kind of ratings is beyond me.
 Max G 	  One of the greatest films I have seen.
 Taylor B 	  The main problem with "Get Out" is not the premise or the fact the concept of the film relies heavily on the race baiting and "social issues" to draw in an audience. The main problem with this film lies in its use of over used, tired, an quick frankly predictable thrill and scary movie tropes which are littered over almost every single film in these two genres. Oh the sound track cut out and now the film is mostly silent, here comes a jump scare. Oh no the main character suffers a traumatic experience, well guess what it may have just been a dream maybe. What that? The main character has some emotional baggage from a family member dying? Its not like I've seen that a million times. I could handle heavy handed message of the film and I could stand how many shots were taken at white people throughout, but don't make a movie that supposed to some social commentary on a very specific topic without at least having an original and well written script. Jordan Peele as a writer has the ability to write something better, and we should know this from projects like Key & Peele. Yet sadly this film falls just short of passable when it could have been something outstanding and truly unique. I am sorry but this movie really isn't worth the full ticket price would pay to see it. Fortunately I have a discount movie day at the theater in my town so I only had to pay $5 to see this film. on a scale of 1-10 I'd give Jordan Peele's "Get Out" a 7-7.5/10, worth viewing but not in theaters.
 Alexander M 	  This is an amazing movie.
 Dante D 	  Very interesting, I was surprised Jordan Peele did so well. The movie wasn't intense for a while, but when it did, very intense. Overall, very awesome
 Ryan S 	  An important horror movie, though its strangeness and dark humor at times is a tad distracting.
 Evan H 	  I don't normally see movies like this -- just not really interested in the whole thriller/horror thing but I really enjoyed the social commentary. I really recommend anyone who likes Jordan Peele's writing check this out even if you're not into the genre.
 Russ B 	  This is the Skeleton Key copy
 Walter H 	  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Well written, great acting, suspense, comedy and great story line. Goes to show that you don't need a big budget to make a great movie.
 Ernst D. B 	  ay I recommend this film. I only had two turn offs which were of the cheesy horror movie ilk ( just two ) which I can accept because given all the "devices used" there was a fair and balanced application of said devices. On social commentary again top scores here especially after watching "I am not your Negro" documentary the week before. One aspect that is not commented on is the "Sci Fi" aspect to the film here. So all things considered I give 100% satisfaction for time and money spent and recommend seeing this film.
 Shiv N 	  Get Out is a MUST watch! It is a Mystery, Comedy like no other. I had ZERO expectations from this movie. I had seen the trailer when it came out and had no interest in watching the movie. But then I saw that it was 100% on the Tomatometer with over 100 reviews, so just out of curiosity I went to watch it. I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. And my oh my, was I blown away!Acting wise, everyone is just brilliant. It's good to see Daniel Kaluuya (Black Morror S1E2) and Allison Williams (Girls) play leads here. But LilRel Howery steals the show in few small scenes he is in. That guy got me good. On IMDB you will get a one line story for this movie - A young African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate. And that is all you should know before you go watch this movie. SERIOUSLY, DO NOT TRY TO FIND OUT ANYTHING ELSE!Just go to the theater and let director Jordan Peele take you on this strange, yet satisfying journey. It is not just scary and funny, but also super relevant in this Trump's America.Get this:Get Out was 100% on Tomatometer till yesterday, and today it dropped to 99% because of ONE bad review by Armond White. Who is Armond White? He is the same ASS who gave a negative review for Toy Story 3 and made that movie's rating drop to 99%.
 Gilbert R 	  Good crazy movie. Smart idea story.
 Demetrius R 	  Hands down best movie of the year. Shocking to come from a new director/producer.
 Alex M 	  Great movie .. the story line was great...
 Jo-Jo T 	  I felt like there should have been more to the story. The concept of racism as the main issue of the movie is a new one and for that I give it a nice try. It was completely predictable from the beginning I knew what was going to happen at the end. Which left me disappointed when I was right. The only entertaining parts were with the TSA, although those were a little corny as well.
 Cameron B 	  Not a horror move, story line makes no sense, characters unlikable, ending amateurish, 135 minute build up was way too long for a 144 minute film.
 Jonathan D 	  A Xerox of the 1975 film "The Stepford Wives" in a different coat of a paint. I thought this was going to be original. Can't believe anyone is praising it because it's far from original.
 Tristen M 	  Get Out was a movie that brought a great eerie and suspensful feeling while also bringing comedy elements to the storyline. Jordan Peele knocked it out of the park with this movie and this makes me look forward to future work of his. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of horror movies.
 Jake P 	  Wow this was crazy, so many things I would have never expected
 Joi C 	  Awesome movie. Will see again. Great plot and twists
 Vania C 	  This movie was insanely good. I wasn't just in love with jump scares and funny sarcasm, but the whole moral of the story. Chris, a black man, stars as a main character for a horror movie, when most of the time the stars are white. Rose and her family were under some spooky stuff as well as the two creepy helpers, who are creepy for a reason. I really loved this movie and I would definitely watch it again, and again, and again . . . . .
 Robbie R 	  Intelligent, insightful, satirical and funny - brilliantly acted. Why can't more movies be like this one?
 Joel C 	  amazing. even better as a point of discussion with other people after watching the movie. brilliant
 Erin c 	  This is the most incredibly written film I have ever seen.
 Yasser A 	  Never. Meet. The parents.
 Brian C 	  Ok, I found out this movie is making fun of white leftist liberal "democrats" assume blacks are too fucking stupid/retarded to take care of themselves. So, they use hypnosis to fix them *wink* wink.
 Alfonso A 	  The movie was good but not on the level of what the critics are saying.
 Ben B 	  It lives up to the 99% Rotten Tomatoes hype. A solid horror/thriller with scares, a cool eerie vibe, humor, and great performances. Jordan Peele's directorial debut looks to be the start of long career behind the camera.
 c p 	  Saw the trailer and thought..."Holy crap, this looks unbelievably racist!". Then I saw it was 99% fresh on rottentomatoes and thought... "Wow, I should give this a shot - it must be great satire/horror!". Then I saw the movie and said..."Meh...". It has a few stereotypical racial laughs, a pretty funny B-line character (TSA agent) but the rest of the movie is decidedly unoriginal and bland. The only thing that sets it at all apart is the racial aspect. I'm actually pretty confused as to why this movie is rating so high... Don't get me wrong, it is not bad; it is decidedly mediocre in every respect.
 David R 	  So good! It had a nice mix of horror, style and character. "Get Out"never gets stuck in the heaviness, self-referential or cliche that most horror movies succumb to, instead it maintains a confidence in its storytelling that makes it wonderful to watch. It fires on all cylinders!
 Barouk A 	  SPOILERSThe fact of the matter is, "Get Out" was an absolutely drab and predictable movie. In the end, I sat in the cinema, hearing all the cheers as the black protagonist drives away from a house full of his butchered white victims wondering, is this all it takes for people to get excited? For a film that has 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, perfect albeit one rotten review from a black film critic, I expected a well made film that challenged the culture of inter-racial relationships and semi-racist undertones in white suburban families. "I know Tiger", "I would have voted for Obama three times". And it does, in a way, with subverted humor try to show the unique relationship between African Americans and white people in this country. But where does it go? Exactly where you think! And that's the problem. The movie follows a textbook storyline that doesn't leave you in any sort of intrigue whatsoever. The movie falls into a pit of despair the more you watch, and the more you realize there are no surprises waiting on the other end.
 Nina J 	  Such a great film. Layered. Deep. Peele knocks it out of the park with this one!!
 Zack L 	  Keeps you on the edge of your seat till the last second! Fantastic movie and actually pretty funny too.
 Brittany G 	  This is such an appropriate psychological thriller for this generation. It will go down in cinematic history alongside Silence of the Lambs.... Brilliant and scary.... Though provoking, yet leaves the viewer entertained yet sickened.... You can't look away even though you want to scream.... Brilliant writing and acting brings this whole movie together.... Yet one question remains....did anyone go back for Andrew?!
 Leslie V 	  I'll never talk to another white women again. GREAT MOVIE though.
 Tiffany J L 	  Good and interesting!
 Colin B 	  Incredible, and unique film. truly original horror film.
 Mathew N 	  The best film of 2017. As if Guess who's coming to dinner? meets The Shining.
 Kasey S 	  My fianc woke me up because I was snoring so loud that I was annoying the people next to us... after we watched for maybe 5-10 more minutes before deciding watching paint dry would be better and left. WTF IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
 Winston B 	  I just saw Get Out and I am happy to say that the title of the movie is NOT a warning to the audience. Get Out is directed by Jordan Peele, which is surprising when you realize that he is most well known for the hilarious comedy sketch show Key and Peele. However, the thing that Key and Peele was best at was mixing comedy with different genres, and that's what makes Get Out so great. It mixes humor and horror until they essentially become one and the same. And it's brilliant. The movie will go from a genuinely humorous moment to a genuinely freaky moment at the drop of a hat and it doesn't feel the least bit jarring. The movie is also populated with great actors who are all on their A-Game, especially the guy who plays the main character's best friend. He was hilarious. Honestly, another thing I loved about the movie was the runtime. It gets in and gets out (pun definitely intended) managing to never overstay it's welcome. Aside from a couple moments in the first act that are obviously only meant to be easy scares for the audience as they don't really make sense upon further realizations in the movie, I really can't find any flaws with Get Out. The only way I wouldn't recommend this movie is if you're part of a relationship involving a white girl and a black guy, because that would be a really awkward viewing experience.
 Sherin S 	  I don't do scary movies and this one spooked me. Interesting, though....who's gonna come hold me tonight so I can sleep?? ??
 Aaron T 	  Worst movie I've seen in a decade!
 Leonardo B 	  An EXCELLENT movie that'll make you leave the theaters as if on drugs and will also have you talk about its subtle commentary this film hints out throughout!
 Patrick M 	  Don't trust the reviews this was a horrible movie!
 Adam H 	  An original idea, my an amazingly creative, funny and talented director. It will really make you think, Highly recommend.
 Richard S 	  Don't watch that spoiler-filled trailer!!!!!!!!!Fun but not scary.
 Troy A 	  Near F'n perfect...! Hitchcock style baby!
 Deniz M 	  First went in seeing this getting a 100% or 99% if you count the troll review, on Rotten Tomatoes so my expectations were SKY HIGH.Look the movie is good, but really gets super cheesy towards the end. Really white people harvesting black bodies to put their brains in them to be immortal or have more athleticism? And this is all done in a makeshift operating room at the house performed by her neurosurgeon father. LMFAO.. woooow you got to be kidding me. And to think movies have actually got lessor ratings in the past for not being believable. Tell me again how this movie got 99% rating. LOL
 Han C 	  Awesome, disturbing, creative, gasping, and definitely unexpected! I highly recommend this movie....just have a meal before hand.
 Judson H 	  Not what I was expecting, but a really funny, thought provoking film. Not what I would call a "horror" film, but it certainly has it's moments. Well directed and well written, definitely worth checking out.
 Trey S 	  Amazing movie I loved it start to finish
 Jiohnny M 	  Really didn't see what all of the fuss was about..
 Micah F 	  What makes "Get Out" so genius is the layering it presents to the viewer. The deeper into the plot we go, the more of what is *actually* happening in the film's world we discover. However, even along the way when things are still uncertain and motives unclear, the dialogue, visual cues, events, setting, etc., are full of historical and social commentary that the more astute viewers will catch onto. For me, it worked.What we have here is a film that has so many different levels of meaning, and yet at the same time is just a fun comedy-horror flick that would have been worthwhile on its own even without all the extra depth. But that extra depth elevates it from just being another "good horror movie" and makes it a standout film that works in multiple intellectual settings and across genres. It's a thinker's movie, for sure. The real-world poignancy is there, but Jordan Peele trusts his audience to find it on their own without spoon-feeding or hitting them over the head with the symbolism.Best and most thoughtful horror film I've seen since "The Babadook."
 Saul M 	  Peele's expertise in comedies shine in this movie that goes in depth and touches on all the racial injustices a black man can face. The jokes have great timing and don't feel forced, it can get creepy and downright uncomfortable, but keeps everyone thinking and talking. 1000000/10
 Anthony D 	  loved it. very symbolic. excellent job Jordan Peele.
 Rick B 	  For the life of me, I can't see why anyone would like this film. The finale is telegraphed from the beginning. A purely formula scare flick with its only claim of creative art being an interracial relationship. The critic and viewer ratings here defy gravity. The only compliment I could offer is for production values. I sat through the entire film thinking "there's gonna be a really interesting twist coming up here somewhere", to no avail. Surprise - guess who gets it the end? Yuk.
 ROBERT M 	  perfect mix of funny, creepy, scary. made me jump in my seat multiple times. best movie I've seen in a long time!
 Stephen O 	  Beautiful twisting, humorous, and yes a little scary
 AW C 	  Get Out's sluggish pacing and mediocre characters keep the fun-enough film from achieving greatness.
 Charles Y 	  kaluuya great, williams beautiful...storyline good for first 2/3 of movie...after that the train runs off the tracks...
 Eileen K 	  Freakiest movie ever. WTF??? If I didn't have to put any stars I wouldn't
 Ellsworth N 	  Movie was absolutely great!
 Rod H 	  Great story & acting.
 Rodrigo G 	  Excellent film has absolutely no flaws, I laughed, I cried, and I cringed hard reading all the reviews from the people we young gentlemen call "Snowflakes". Claiming this film is racist, why if you ask me you have to be a damn cry baby to really look at it this way. If you like to be offended by anything that doesn't agree to your point of view then I highly recommend not watching it because there is a 100% chance you will be offended for no god damn reason. If you're a normal human being that enjoys a good comedy thriller than I highly recommend the film.
 Frank M 	  This is a very average movie with a completely ridiculous payoff. Written by a very funny man that put nearly zero funny moments in this flick. Would have been fine as a 20 minute Twilight Zone episode but was a lot of nothing happening for a lot of the time.
 Brett P 	  Horror movies this inventive, topical, and well-shot are few and far between.
 Lucian E 	  Film was everything! The fear factor of everyday life for Poc was shown with awesome clarity. Horror twisted with psychological thriller. Brilliant.
 Joel R 	  Is a great Horror movie... And have it's own way of showing tension...
 Oren T 	  Unoriginal idea. See "Skeleton Key." It's ridiculous this movie received any positive reviews.
 Summer W 	  This movie was different and a breath of fresh air. You don't expect that type of social insight in a thriller. It is a movie that really makes one think, but I think it will resonate more to those who get ignored in the dominant society and those who are treated like they are less than human. You don't have to be black to get the allegory. You can be someone whose boss treats you like just another number, a woman who is liked only for her looks, a rich man only liked for his money. Let's not act like there aren't members of society that are less cared about other than ways they can be exploited. Go deeper than the surface when watching this.
 Steph C 	  This was an extremely racist and offensive movie. If I were Caucasian I would protest this movie. It's not right.
 Loring P 	  Provocative thriller that puts the audience in the shoes of its black protagonist. Still not sure how I feel about its take on white women/the femme fatale, but I'm damn glad I saw it.
 Kelley M 	  Great movie and really fun to watch in the theater!
 Vin U 	  Just saw it last night; it was great. Given it's success, I have two predictions: 1)There will be a sequel... 'Stay Out.' 2)There will be a rash of copy-cat movies in which the main character is the only (fill in blank) amongst a group of (fill in blank)s.
 Geerthik G 	  Amazing. Best movie of 2017.
 Anthony R 	  Eye opening movie. It has alot of subliminal messages for those who understand them.
 Xavier G 	  These one star reviews are obviously people who can't accept a black director in 2017 making stereotype jokes about white people without getting in their feelings. These people went to go see this movie with biased feelings towards it before they bought their tickets and wishing it would bomb but instead it did the opposite and their pride won't let them be wrong so they wrote terrible reviews. go see the movie and form your own opinion it's 2017 it's OK to accept a black director
 Rebecca S 	  Smart, scary, and so good/thought-provoking I's still thinking about it a week later.
 Robert p 	  Great idea, kinda of original but they went to far with it. They should have stuck with just the hypnotism factor. That may not be believable either, but more believable then the the original story.
 Sprit F 	  Saw it, not very good
 Dexter T 	  Great movie with imagination
 Aaron G 	  very original, not a description you can use with movies coming out today.
 Tommy U 	  Loved this movie????
 Fred G S 	  Wow! I/we didn't see that coming!! There were a few things that would have made this film much better than it was, and it was good. Even though society really doesn't care about this, there was far too much foul language and vulgar conversation in this film. It was completely unnecessary and things would have been fine without them. The meat of the plot went a bit over the top and could have been dialed down to a more realistic deviance. Also the skin color dynamic turned some people off just a bit, my wife being one of them. It may have had satirical undertones but the film would have been fine without this interjection. Overall a different take on horror that had me dreaming about it that night and a bit nervous before I woke up.
 Phillip  	  An excellent work of suspense and bringing new, interesting perspective to the relatable uneasiness of meeting your partner's parents.
 RAYMOND B 	  Great Movie Great modern day plot and good acting considering the cast of un-knowns
 Edgar S 	  Spoiler Alert: White people kidnapping and hypnotizing black people to steal their bodies because they are genetically superior? How is this not considered racist? Flip the roles and see if it gets positive reviews then.
 Cutter R 	  This was the perfect combination of suspense, mystery, and overall comedy, I have yet to experience a movie with such a good balance where I was petrified yet laughing out of my seat at the same time and it wasn't cheesy at all.
 broforcesquad . 	  Very rarely in this day and age can you go into a movie and still be surprised. With all the marketing films get, and the internet being a great place to spoil anything and everything before you actually go experience it, I was not expecting 'Get Out' to have much up it's sleeve that I didn't see coming. I was wrong. Jordan Peele of 'Key and Peele' fame might have been the best kept secret in Hollywood behind the camera. While he has made a living cracking us up with his modern day slap-stick on the screen, what he writes and directs in this movie has me already wanting to know what his next project is. Without spoiling anything, 'Get Out' is a movie that you walk into the theater expecting to deliver one message about social norms and how they affect race relations, and you end up getting a surprisingly funny and poignant look at this dynamic from a totally different point of view, with some great plot twists and turns. Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams take this movie by the horns and make it do whatever they want. Next time Jordan Peele directs anything, even a Trident commercial, I'm dropping everything that I'm doing and watching it.
 Nick K 	  **Spoiler Alerts**While this movie can be funny at times, and cleverly tackles issues like casual racism well, it is drastically overrated. My frustrations are largely with the brain swap reveal in the movie. It doesn't make sense that you can replace the brain in the host body and the victim can still be summoned with a camera flash. The fact that the grandparents are pretending to be servants makes no sense. They could have posed as family friends and it would have been far more believable. I think the film should have went along a different line. The mother should have been hypnotizing the victims and selling them off as brainwashed slaves. It would have been far more powerful and diabolical then a goofy brain trade bit.I also think the straight man/goofy friend bit got incredibly old by the end of the movie. Wouldn't recommend this film to others
 muhammad A 	  Loved this fresh thriller. One thing it does is definitely makes Blacks not trust white girls lol
 Henry B 	  Yep, it's that good.
 Michael L 	  This movie has does great at building suspense and it does well with keeping things feeling tense. However, the ending is a little weak and the more I think about it the less it makes sense.
 Raul G 	  Pacing was a little off, but I enjoyed it
 Ragan A 	  Similar plot to skeleton key
 Jacob P 	  I had high expectations for this movie based on reviews and word of mouth and after seeing it I cannot say it was anything special. Very good movie for one with such little budget but still, nothing but a normal horror movie to me.
 Greg M 	  wow critics gave this movie more fresh tomatoes than Logan. Another cheap movie scam. When will the audience learn?
 Grant V 	  Pure genius. One of the best horror movies to come out in quite some time. A film with a lot of layers and symbolism. The entire cast across the board is great and the ending is truly fantastic.
 Robert D 	  Whoa. This is like "The Stepford Wives" meets "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" meets "You're Next" meets "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." Horror films have really delivered lately.
 Jacob M 	  Get Out Review (2017) The GoodThe Acting across the board is fantastiicDaniel Kaluuya (who was basically nothing in Kick-Ass 2) definitely got better as an Actor he's someone to watch out forNewcomer Lil Rel Howery easily stole the movie he was just hilarious all his lines reminded me of Classic Key &_Peele.Allison Williams mainly known from Girls I had no idea she had this in her she was fantasticBradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are great.The Jump Scares are really effective Comedic Timing is fantasticThe Script is very SmartThe real MVP of this movie is Jordan Peele what a fantastic Directorial Debut can't wait to see what he directs next.One of the best endings in a Horror MovieThe BadThe Pacing isn't the best in some pointsOverall: This is the one of Best Horror Movies this year with Split hopefully we can get more .Overall Grade: A
 Matthew J 	  Im not sure how the heck this had a 99% rating from critics. You can see the "plot twist" from a mile away. This "horror" movie was not scary nor thrilling one bit. Its like the critics and users are giving this movie such good reviews because it depicts white people in a bad way.
 Michael F 	  A fantastic first film from a man that really knows the genre. Effective and Unnerving.
 Morgan G 	  This looked like a silly movie from the trailer. I thought there must have been something I was missing from the 99% RT rating. turns out there's not. it's a dumb reverse racism movie. I walked out of the theater. every second of every scene was the protagonist dealing with racism, with the same dumb emotionless look on his face. I walked out in a scene when some retarded 60 year old rich white woman made some sexual reference about black men. Alison Williams was the only character in the movie that had the ability to react in any sort of normal way to crap other people were saying. this made me so mad... this is a movie you watch for a half hour on Netflix after you've given up searching for something good. I rely on RT ratings to pick out a standout. these ratings are certainly being bought. EF!
 Jonathan M 	  Way overrated. Definitely not better than Logan
 DoJuan C 	  Great movie, but the ending could've been better!
 PJ K 	  This film is far better than it's trailer might suggest. Very clever, intelligently done and not really a horror movie at all. More of a comedy thriller. Highly recommended.
 Chris Y 	  Was honestly not that great of a movie from a horror or suspense standpoint (unless you're black, I guess) and if the script was written for a white male main character going to visit a black girl's family and all sorts of black stereotypes were thrown at us the whole movie, this shit never would have been made. Fuck racism against anyone. Why does this movie get a pass? Simply because the villains are white. Would not have made it past the idea concept stage if the villain was a crazy black family hell-bent on stealing white people for their "privileges"Thumbs down
 Dan D 	  Get Out may have a few plausibility issues, but otherwise, it's a fantastic film. Peele put a lot of thought into it, and you can tell by the directing and the intrecet story. He let's the viewer uncover half the plot without narration and sometimes little dialouge, and makes you put the pieces together by the time the credits roll. The opening was attention-grabbing, and the climax was some of the best I've seen in a long time. The rising action is slow at times, but it pays off later, and I was at the edge of my seat. It's a modern classic of suspense and horror, and I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.
 Clarence C 	  excellent movie! Good movies are not made by their budgets, but rather by its content.
 Tony D 	  This overly-hyped movie sucked from beginning to end. So many holes needed to be filled it made no sense.
 Jason M 	  well filmed, but a very predictable twist/ story line. movie basicly suggest white people as bad, and victomizes black people. not something very progressive to a young mind
 Brian B 	  Looks promising. I want to see.
 Isaac H 	  Best movie released in years!!!!
 Mike M 	  Simply incredible movie, very well written and directed. This movie is a must see for 2017.
 Trevor D 	  Loved it. Suspenseful/scary yet has some funny parts. I'd watch it again!
 Kameron W 	  My initial reaction to finding out Jordan Peele was directing a movie was that I needed to see it. After watching Get Out I now have the same desire to see any film he directs
 Jeb E 	  I thought this was smart, funny, and legitimately scary, with lots of important things to say in an age where colorblind racism has revealed itself to be what it always really was: a thin veneer hiding the violence of white supremacy. Much of the trauma of racism (and misogyny, and trauma in general) seems firmly rooted in taking away someone's fundamental autonomy, the control of their own body, and Get Out explores that idea in an unexpected but very clever--and horrifying--way.
 Karen B 	  Disturbing and compelling. It's like Stepford Wives meets Body Snatchers meets The Help. Watch it, even if you're not normally a fan of this genre. It's important.
 billy b 	  Get Out is one survivors tale on the Hidden World of Predatory Organ Trafficking in minority communities. This movie addresses the eternal archetypal theme of "Stealing Black People" for body parts. -- see Jung for more on this!So, Check Yourself. Peace.
 David F 	  Not gonna waste my money, of course liberal critics give it 99%.
 Daija N 	  AMAZING!! This movie was the best movie I've seen this year. I work at the movie theater so I have the opportunity to watch all the newly released movies but this was so far the best. I went in the theater knowing nothing about the movie other than the title. It had a great way of combining comedy with scary. If there were more stars I would give it 10.
 javier V 	  Get out is the movie that is meant for people who understand what it is like being the black sheep of the flock, or in this case the black boyfriend of the white family. This is more suspenseful and funny than a labeling it as a horror film. For Jordan Peele's first written and directed movie, it is really well done and shot. Its practically an M. Night Shyamalan film with the films unseen plot twist. Get Out deserves almost a four star rating but nothing less than three. Its funny, suspenseful, and extremely mysterious, but its not like anyone hasn't been curious when they visit their girlfriend/boyfriends house.
 Jamison K 	  Humorous race bait, not scary, unless your black, adds fuel to the race fire by stating whites covit blacks enough to... (no spoilers)The sad part is, a movie with roles reversed would be a debocale and not played nationwide
 CEL L 	  The subliminal leads to the plot and climax from the begining is so creatively done along with how the writing is. Definitely a must watch!
 Chris C 	  One of the best movies I've seen in a loonnnng time! Gives me chills thinking about this happening in real life!
 tony i 	  the context of white supremacy...... white people do not want to see movies which depict their obvious racism. White people do not like to be shown who & what they are especially from the perspective of a black man. rolmfao...... However.... none of these angry racist who've commented have never expressed the same outrage with films where white people play roles of characters who are obviously black or @ the very least should be....these movies are often set on geographical areas where white people have no history nor any history of being able to live in those locations. A perfect examply would be ANY movie where white people are playing biblical / "Egyptian" AFRICAN God or leader of some sort..... Hell look how long white people got away with jesus being white & that lie not being questioned..We need more movies depicting white people the way we see them in equal proportion to the movies & tv shows where they do the same to us.
 Jonah R 	  most thrilling movie everrrr
 John M 	  The film is a weak re-telling of the much more terrifying "The Loved Ones"- I couldnt really get into this one- this has it's moments but does anyone else think Rotten Tomatoes has been bought and paid for in so far as recent ratings?
 Jennifer A 	  This movie was literally garbage.
 Richard L 	  Though this is a good movie, the film's themes have been addressed before.Go watch, 'Nothing But the Night' (1973), 'Angel Heart' (1987), The Skeleton Key (2005) or any of the Stepford Wives films to see this has been done before.This may be far far better, but it isn't truly original.
 Tony S 	  Scary, prophetic, important, powerful. A wonderful script, excellent performances and tight direction.
 JeRome K 	  Well done. Good flow. Excellent acting. Funny and scary. Lil' too violent in some parts for my tastes but great twists at the end.---- Moral: Having a cup of tea is either good or bad and so is having more than one cup or none at all. #checkitout #hitthriller #jordanpeeleRules #jordanpeele #JeROMEcomedy #sleeperOfTheWinter
 Said C 	  i liked this movie a lot. good solid movie.
 Brian F 	  How could this get 99%. Movie sucked. Tomato meter is officially worthless. Used to trust them, but no more. The tomatometer has officially peaked.
 Tamara A 	  Touches all emotions. The savage ending was intense. I'd label this a Psychological Thriller instead of Horror tho...(hunt for easter eggs ~)
 John N 	  Did you see Being John Malkovich? Well, add in a layer of white guilt and you get this steaming pile. It's like the white people they make fun of reviewed this movie and gave it a high rating. There are odd moments at the beginning that give you a real sense of horror. Then it falls miserably flat.
 Brandy C 	  I'd be lying if I said this movie didn't paint white people in a bad light. I hate to say it, I really do. I felt awkward just being in the theater half way through it. And though it might not have dawned on a lot of people, I saw the plot twist right away... well, guessed, anyway.Those things being said,. this was actually a great movie. wasn't too slow, there were things happening in every scene and every scene meant something up until the very last one. I give this movie 4/5 stars, very entertaining. Seeing it in theaters is a must. Its a thrill ride with a slightly comedic flair.
 Boylan E 	  I was so disappointed in this movie. After hearing all the hype I was really looking forward to a good suspenseful movie that additionally addressed the issue of race. This was not. First of all there was absolutely no character development whatsoever. We got a brief, but confusing history of the protagonist, and learning nothing of the parents, the girlfriend, or the grandparents. The procedure was never explained to us. We should just assume that when you transfer one brain to another body that a mere flash of light will reverse the surgery....I don't think so. So much more could have been done with this film to make it grade A. It's pretty much the Skeleton Key with less suspense, intrigue, explanation, and development. Side note: To all the white people out there complaining that this film is racist toward whites, you're morons. Get a grip on reality.
 Tyler H 	  A movie that throws stereotypes in your face without its story going the stereotypical route. It makes things that are right be wrong at the same type and vice versa. There are so many brilliant levels of this movie just waiting to be peeled like an onion which is quite coincidental being that the writer/director's name is Jordan Peele. How someone so involved in the comedy scene made one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen is beyond my understanding. The ending may be the best feeling fake out you've ever felt like you were so happy you just got faked out rather than mad because it was pure genius. I'd give it ten stars if I could.
 Brandon C 	  A thrilling horror movie that nixes common cliches. 85/100.
 Tyler C 	  Boring, heavy handed, not scary.
 sami t 	  Great film and for all of you white people admit it was a good movie just because you guys are the bad people in a movie don't pretend like it wasn't good stop being butthurt. GREAT FILM :)
 Ashawnta B 	  I can't even put into words how much I LOVED this movie! Well needed
 Daniel S 	  This is the best movie of it's genre. The concept of the movie was second to one. It was like all movie genres in one; the action, the comedy, the romance, you name it and they all were just perfectly-timed to fit in the movie.
 Natalie C 	  Very good movie not what I expected.
 Quentin M 	  Good and different movie
 Ricardo B 	  Fresh, great acting, tension kept til the end.
 Jonas I 	  Absolutely horrible! Can't believe this got a 99% rating.
 Izac V 	  Pretty brilliant for a horror movie. The only reason I don't give it the full 5 stars is that I have seen scarier films but it didn't really knock this down too much. It was very thrilling and had humor at just the right time. By excelling at the humor/horror elements, Jordan peele made a compelling hybrid film that had an even deeper purpose and message: to say that racism is still very deeply rooted in society today, and is still very prevalent. He told this message in a deeply troubling and effective manner.
 Cristina S 	  Excellent movie. Don't miss it, The audience was very enthusiastic.
 Charley P 	  FUUUUUUUUUUUCK THAT WAS A GOOD GOOD MOVIE! It Was extremely thrilling and also had the comedic charm I was expecting from Jordan Peele. I loved it so so so so so much!
 Dominique K 	  Love the Twist. For the people who think its a racist movie its not, they're actually the lead characters, it's about a colt that literally obsessed with African American's and wants what's so special from them, etc... and again there's a twist. Jordan Peele is the Director and I think he did an Amazing Job!
 Bryce W 	  Brought in a new beginning in horror movies.
 Edward T 	  Great Movie! It didn't go as I expected & was quite a surprise... that's what I Loved about it!!!
 Nika C 	  Wow this movie was really good. I have never had so much satisfaction from watching a character murder people beacause they deserve it than this movie.
 Randy R 	  A horror movie that makes you think? Here it is!
 tom k 	  expected more seeing reviews
 Frances B 	  Couldn't seem to make up it's mind about what it wanted to be. Very disappointing, it could have been so good. I thought that it started differently than it ended, and was not a comedy or really a thriller...
 Brice T 	  In this "horror" film, Jordan Peele proved he can do more than just comedies. All actors and actresses gave great performances, especially Lil Rel Howery's character whom stole the show each time he was showed, producing the comic relief of the film. Although portrayed to seem like a horror movie, this very serious and intense film had lots of laughable parts, yet I didn't find it to be particularly scary, with lots of generic and predictable jump scares, some that didn't further the plot in anyway and were just there to scare the audience. Although the conflict and climax isn't delved into in a very detailed manner and feels very brief, it manages to hold the interest of the audience and remain entertaining. The cinematography emits a nice atmosphere for the film, especially starting with an amazing beginning scene with good camera use and score choice that sets the tone for the rest of the film. Also, luckily for any film fanatic, the movie has an original concept, as well as being relatable to society today. Despite it's small flaws that are relatively easy to overlook, the film is very enjoyable and is one of the first must sees of the year.
 Wes T 	  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Thanks to Armond White's review I had to see what all of the hype was about and his false negative review backfired because it made me want to see the movie. The subtle racial references and symbols in the movie were the most enjoyable part for me.
 Julio R 	  Psychologically inferior, the expense of what was experienced. The cover shows Chris with hypnotized, tearing shocked eyes, but one that cannot be hypnotized further by others, a trademark of what is to be.
 Timothy W 	  Jordan Peele, not bad for a first time director. This is a good movie for a good couple because you will expect something you are not prepared for and honestly you may need to watch it more than once to even understand what it is about.
 Matt R 	  Try not to read any reviews or watch a trailer if at all possible! Great twisted highly entertaining fun flick.
 Neptune R 	  THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD
 Philomena R 	  Too violent - the worst is when violent movies are funny.
 Alejandro F 	  extraa pelicula pero estuvo interesante y diferente
 Matt S 	  slow to develop. A bit predictable in the end. I did like the way they don't shy away from the topic of racism in America.
 Izkalotzin G 	  Perfect horror movie! I loved it :)
 Karen W 	  Well written, well acted, not a rerun of every other movie you've ever seen. Original. I really enjoyed it.
 Tiffany H 	  I'm a truly horror fanatic fan, but this was truly a horrible film. It wasn't scary, I didn't enjoy the film maker adding his racism or beliefs of white people in the movie. It was a horrible movie!!!!
 richard c 	  skeleton key. hello.
 Steve G 	  I was expecting tons of jump scares to a cheesy movie. I went in sight unseen and did not know a thing about it. VERY intriguing, very wierd, very funny and very scary. Not for everyone but I do recommend!
 Nikki L 	  I don't usually go for horror films, and I'd rather read a mystery/suspense novel than watch one on screen, but Get Out was a worthwhile break from my regular habits. I appreciate how the expected was intertwined with the unexpected as we watched the story unfold. This is a film that should be watched in a theater with a lot of other people; hearing others' reactions adds to the experience. Jordan Peele put his foot all up IN this movie! I appreciate how he artfully illustrated societal horrors in such an imaginative way.
 Christopher P 	  Wow. Was not expecting that!
 Samuel%20 W 	  Jordan Peele's Artistic take on Racism really draws an desirable attention to this film.
 Matthew a 	  Great horror film that added a twist driven by race. Understandably it is a movie so don't get worked up by the story line although in today's time it's quite annoying that you can't even enjoy a movie without having a race influencing your thoughts. Overall a strong story line with some laughter thrown in throughout, followed up by an action packed ending to top it off. See!
 nhar l 	  Finally a clever plot and interesting characters!
 mock s 	  99% lololololololol.
 Franklyn C 	  The most surprising thing about this movie is that it is a piece of trash. I believed the hype that this was some psychological thriller/commentary on racism. It has nice suspenseful buildup during the storyline, but what happens next is foreseeable and not thrilling or scary. *Black guy sits down with a psychologist - he gets hypnotized* *Black guy goes out in the dark - he gets scared* While the lead male character is portrayed realistically, the rest of the characters and dialigue aren't. The storyline offers no new insight about racism. It is predictable down to you can figure out who the bad guys are, and what happens to the victims. What's worse is the fact that The Black Guy has to resort to violence to get away from the bad white people, and even that doesn't come as a surprise in the movie. This is neither a clever commentary on racism NOR a suspenseful thriller. It's a well-edited okay movie.
 Drucef S 	  Dope,  horror/suspense/thriller/dark Comedy
 Timothy J 	  Going into it I was not quite sure what to expect, but the movie was excellent. It is totally and wonderfully crazy, but very funny at times, and the whole audience enjoyed the ride. For instance, everyone clapped at the end when the protagonist's friend arrives. I don't want to put any more spoilers in the review, but I think it will appeal to most audiences. Unless you're a Klan member, that is.
 Mike K 	  I thought it was racist against white people. It will prolly win an Oscar. I think the reason "Get out" didn't work, was that we couldn't identify with the main character. I didn't "get" the ebonic jokes or references. I live in Maine, so we don't get exposed to it much, except on TV.
 George H 	  Spectacularly original, a phenomenal psychological thriller. Jordan Peele weaves a masterful nightmare with humor and paranoia. An instant horror classic.
 Todd P 	  saw the trailer. thought it kinda sucked. might watch it on netflix.
 William B 	  This movie is so witty, & smart, it's crazy great. Definitely one of the best movies of the year so far!
 Skye S 	  This was just a well-made film. The story was clear. The cinematography was on point. The acting was great. It was a solid film, Jordan Peele did a fantastic job!
 Adam Y 	  Great Movie. Suspensful and Hilarious.
 Terry N 	  honestly, this had to be one of the best psychological thrillers to come out in a long time. There wasn't a single moment where you felt that the way things went down was corny or obvious and that alone made the movie top notch. The added bits of comedy thanks to be Jordan Peele being behind the movie made it and all around classic, and the concept of racism and slavery still happening today and the futuristic concepts of how it all goes down really ties then whole movie together in a package filled with pure epic cinema...
 Jenny B 	  why do we watch racist movies
 Jaleel Z 	  It's all in the details with this movie. After you watch it, when you sit back and really think about it you really take in how great this movie was put together.
 Laura B 	  I thought it was great. This movie was dark and complex, and dealt with liberal racism that lays all throughout this countryExcellent first film from me Peele
 Not L 	  Birth of a Nation for our generation.
 Samuel L 	  This movie was great! It had a dose of comedy and was a solid thriller. I had no idea what the movie was until 30 minutes or so elapsed.
 Dave H 	  An interesting movie about race relations.
 Stephanie P 	  Very thought provoking movie that takes you a suspenseful journey on subliminal race issues.
 Nick S 	  So so movie. Was not suspenseful, plot was easy to figure out only minutes into the movie.
 Facebook U 	  Trust me. You want to get on this thrill ride. Funny with original content and satire on racism, Jordan Peele shines.
 Christine K 	  best horror film ive watched recently !!!!
 Christopher J 	  A great thriller with a fairly original story. Albeit, a lot of what happens was foreseen, but it adds some additional twists to the mix
 Angela D 	  Easily one of best horror movies I've seen in years!!! I've seen it twice so far! Lol Bravo Jordan Peele and to all the actors
 Thee Chad S 	  Please, please, PLEASE keep your dang kids home!
 Theresa S 	  Great concept, but as an African American woman I found it very insulting that, here another movie displaying how white people feel and once treated blacks as if they were not people but on some level cattle to be used for their own personal benefit. This movie was interesting but upsetting, maybe I'm just sensitive to this type of publication.
 Raymond A 	  It's not as good as I expected. The outcome of every scene is very predictable and very confusing at some point. This movie would be better if it was turned into comedy. I would like it better if it was turned into another Scary Movie sequel.
 Daniel S 	  This movie is the best of it's genre. The concept of the movie was just second to none, it couldn't be any better and that's what made the movie unique.
 Mike O 	  This movie was crazy good! Scary, thrilling and funny all at the same time.
 Jocey D 	  Not what I expected. Funny but creepy. That dude won't be falling for any more white chicks!
 Robert B 	  I wanted a different kind of scary and Peele delivered. I was getting tired of the cheesy horrible scary movies coming out lately and thought Get Out was going to be just plain horrible from the trailer. I was devastatingly wrong. Not so much a jumping movie than a twisted mystery with a few surprising laughs. I loved all the weird friends, I loved Peele's creative ways of making us question people in our lives. Listen to your friends when they say go see Get Out.
 Steve S 	  This film suprised me in many ways. I didn't expect it to hav such on-target performances, or such a creepy undertone. Nor did I expect it to have such wit and humor. This ranks as one of the best and most enjoyable thrillers of the past several years.
 Tyler P 	  Really bad you can predict everything that's going to
 Alissa B 	  Excellent thriller, must see, I saw it for $6.00 bucks, wasn't my usually theater though.
 Raven H 	  Jordan Peele is a great writer with a wide range of perception. Daniel Kaluuya is absolutely terrific in the lead!!!
 Gabriel S 	  Very good indeed, with a lot of tension in the air
 Max G 	  A very original horror film with only major pacing issues.
 Bobby C 	  Get Out is an amazing film that is entertaining from beginning to end. The building of tension leading to the climax is well-crafted and the film benefits from its care of the little things. While the film is entertaining, the enjoyment comes from understanding what the film is trying to get across with its symbolism. If you're a person that's not aware of the issues going on with African-American culture or is looking for something to escape the political climate that the country is facing right now, then this film might not be for you. Get Out is a great film and the best film of 2017 as of right now. The film is a perfect blend of social issues, the horror that comes with them, and a comedic tone to help make the topic presentable. We're in for a good year if Get Out is a sign for the quality of films to come.
 Kurt N 	  Wait for it to come out on Netflix. This seemed very low budget and the story much too simple. From the previews I expected so much more. I'm shocked it got such a high rating.
 Atai W 	  I actually have never particularly liked any of Key or Peele's works before this, but OMG this is SOO good lmfao Jordan Peele made something that was really funny, and terrifying at just the right moments. "Get Out" told a great story with really good social commentary and satire. I will remember Jordan Peele for this film and I hope he continues down this path. What a movie !
 Mike L 	  Scary. Inventive. Dark. Poetic.Get In...to see this flick!
 David F 	  This is a capital D Deep film about race wrapped in a horror movie comedy. I so prefer my anti-racism without the self-righteousness or self-seriousness. This movie has style and an attitude, it's funny and scary and it supports the weight of the thousand and one scholarly interpretations strewn down upon it.
 Clara B 	  I had to get out of the theater.
 Ilja S 	  From SNL star Jordan Peele comes a mindbu ggling masterpiece, that manages to fit horror, humor, thrills, drama and sci-fi all into one great film. Get Out will catch your attention in the very first minute and keep you in suspense all throughout the crazy finale. A strange tale and masterfully directed piece of film, that offers something for everyone. Great acting, a outstanding narrative and some social commentary.
 Regina P 	  Extremely entertaining! I feel like seeing it again!
 Justin B 	  In terms of large budget American made horror films, this is probably the best since Cabin in the Woods. Clever, creepy with just enough humour to keep things fun. Most importantly, it's unafraid to tackle risky subject matter and offer a unique twist on what most audiences are probably expecting.
 Anthony N 	  Love this movie it horror and funny this was great movie I would watching 2 time
 Andrew S 	  This movie was excellent, funny, scary, and had phenomenal acting
 Aashish B 	  Terrible, racist flick
 Will M 	  The 2nd best movie I have seen in 2017 so far. This movie touches on the topic of race in the post-Obama age tactfully and in a way that leaves you laughing and in suspense often times simultaneously. The script could have satisfied viewers as a suspense film alone but the added value of using this platform to make a metaphor that about race habits being just as suspenseful as a horror movie to those living the African American experience cannot be measured. The subtle (yet to many of us... not so subtle) symbolic images and coded dialogue give this movie layers that after only one viewing one cannot decipher without the discussions one will have with friends and relatives. Those discussions will be what make this movie a classic. In the post-Obama age these discussions about race and our rave habits are needed not only to identify our mistakes but to help start making strides to improve and eventually eliminate them.
 Tajlia H 	  Cautionary tale... Great film!
 Britton N 	  Fun comedy/horror. 3.5/5
 Gabriela B 	  This is one of the few films that has all genres wrapped into one. The film is a satire, a drama, comedy, romance and a thriller/horror. Beautifully written and directing. I can't wait to see this a second time.
 Michael S 	  One of the year's best movies in January? And it's horror? Yup, and yup. Get Out takes the horror tropes, injects them into a brilliant mystery horror story, turns the whole thing 45 degrees and uses that concoction to unlock a meaningful piece of entertainment with a lot of truths about our society and race relations. A must see, and a future classic.
 W S Paul J 	  Amazing. Incisive. Brutal.
 Angel C 	  Great build up then just fell flat. Reminds me of the skeleton key. I was kinda fighting to stay awake at times.
 Andrew C 	  This movie was unlike anything I have seen. I wasn't scared to death or on the edge of my seat due to suspense, but kind of a mix of both. The movie used cheap jump scares which in most cases would be a bad thing, but for some reason it seemed to fit so well. The plot twist wasn't out of the blue meaning that if you payed attention have a sharp eye for major plot points, you could have guessed it in the first 30 minutes like myself. Get out was able to stay away from a cheap gasp and basically make the audience lose hope In one act. All in all even if you aren't scared by the psychological terror get out is so truly, madly, mercilessly entertaining, even when it makes you want to jump out of your skin.
 Tommy L W 	  This Movie Was Great Real Supence Thriller
 Govind B 	  The greatest horror film of all time.. Well actually it's more funny than scary but extremely entertaining nonetheless.
 Julia S 	  Waste of money and time. The build up was great, fell flat after the first 45 minutes - and the ending, gah! Could have been good, terrible - wait for the netflix.
 Michael D 	  Rather fun little horror film where a 'guess who's coming to dinner' goes awry in a big way. The director manages the smarmy white family scene well with a few surprises along the way. Best scene in the movie house.
 Roberto A 	  One of the best american thriller/horror/comedy movies I've seen in a while.
 Yanely H 	  "Get Out" is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It had so many twists and turns. In the movie theatre, I felt like everyone who was there bonded together. We all cheered for Chris to get out. It has the perfect combination of horror and comedy. 10/10
 Matt W 	  This action packed, suspenseful thriller really grasped my attention and kept me locked in the whole movie. Jordan Peele showed us all the genius behind his ability to direct and write this wonderful movie.
 Terrance E 	  Great movie! Many people will say this is a white guilt movie and get butt hurt. As a black man living in this country, I say it's not. It's more of a satirical take on the microagressions we have to eat everyday. Take a look and just see for yourself.
 Myron S 	  A Really Good Thriller! Kudos to the director! Different, Odd and Uncomfortable. A must see for any Thriller/Suspense/Horror fans.
 Cheryl R 	  Was good way weird but good
 Movie with M 	  The last horror movie I truly enjoyed was probably "Cabin in the Woods". Recently, I liked "Green Room", and "Split", but it continues to be a hard genre to break out with a truly original idea. Jordan Peele's "Get Out" felt like the universe had heard my prayers. A smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor, and yet a still bone chilling plot? How have we been so blessed? The balance of horror and comedy is weighted perfectly, with every release of laughter being used to reset the suspense, giving the audience the chance to build back up to paralyzing fear over and over again. All of the performances were pitch perfect (Alison Williams with the keys!), and I anticipate this is only the beginning of Daniel Kaluuya's rise. I often complain to my friends that the biggest disservice of the horror/thriller genre is that by pigeonholing something as "a scary movie", you isolate a whole demographic of people who want to just go see a blockbuster on the weekends. Having Peele's name attached and released by Universal on the perfect weekend (only up against week 3 of Lego Batman) gave this layered story a chance to breathe and be appreciated for what it is. Creepy as all hell, and maybe a little too believable. 9.2/10
 Daniel W 	  Creepy, funny, and weird as hell. Good movies always keep you thinking about them, I'm still thinking about this one a week later. Good movie but hopefully people won't think that this kind of racism is going on in America, that's a little absurd
 Katia F 	  The best movie of the year so far.. Thanks Peele
 Jason T 	  disappointing appears to be a mismash of past classics and never appears to achieve a successful result.
 Michael C 	  Hitch would love this one. Well done!
 Geahk B 	  A super well executed horror film which ALSO does what the best horror films have done and get deep with subtle social commentary. This film works on multiple levels with enough laughs to break the very real sense of disquiet. A wonderful balance of unease and release.
 Samantha B 	  Was a great movie had my attention the entire movie had lots of twist a little more action would of been nice but was definitely a good movie
 Chad C 	  snoozefest and generic horror film. There's nothing scary or thought provoking about this movie.
 Brandin N 	  Jordan Peele might be a genius ! Can't wait for more novies directed by him! Innovation at it's finest !
 Terrie M 	  So much better than expected. Was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end.
 Cliff J 	  I definitely wondered whether the 99% Rotten Tomatoes score overstated this film's excellence. Well, it didn't. This movie brought fear, insight and laughs at all the right moments. Perfect storytelling and perfect pacing. I suppose I can imagine someone not being entertained by this movie, but it would take a lot of effort. Especially in a packed and diverse theater like the one where I saw the movie.
 Brianna D 	  Interesting Movie. The plot was unique. I really enjoyed this movie. The only thing I would have done differently would be the climax. There is a lot of build up for such a short climax. Overall, I loved the movie.
 Anthony C 	  Definitely a popcorn movie. It's fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. Great debut by Peele
 Stahl M 	  So apt for the times we are living through...
 Christi S 	  You think you know where it's going and then there's more. It's good. With plenty of "what the heck!?" moments.
 Daniel R 	  Boring , not scary , just plain dull ...
 Giovanni P 	  Wow it was a really good movie with an excellent plot yet humorous! Good job Jordan peele! All the actors were good at their parts! lol it's funny !
 Derek R 	  Surprisingly good and wryly fun. Not just a horror movie, like most of my favourite horror movies (e.g. Sleepy Hollow, Cabin in the Woods, 28 Days Later, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil).
 Leroy D 	  What we have here is the rare movie that works on multiple levels and equally as well. If you want to see a horror film and nothing else, that's what you'll see. In fact it's one of the better horror films in recent memory. If you look below the surface though there's a social commentary going on that some people may be uncomfortable with. Not only that, but almost every scene has some type of symbolism, and I'm sure I didn't catch them all. The writing is so clever and with so many subliminal messages that even if someone gets offended by watching this the filmmaker can outright deny it and say you're just seeing things. It's a movie you have to watch twice, because different people are going to get difference experiences from this movie.
 Shits M 	  Jordan Peele wrote a horror thriller that is better than anything Alfred Hitchcock has ever done. I was progressively shocked (mostly because I am a 45 year old introverted white guy who hates news) and thrilled while the climatic ending! Ephasized with the main character (Chris) from the get go, tremendous performances by everybody. Some scenes where so relentlessly creepy they made me laugh uncomfortably. Which is awesome! The obvious humor blends in nicely throughout providing the perfect measures of levity to an otherwise dramatic horror film. The tension builds slowly and then it doesn't let up until the very end. Can't wait to see it again!
 Joey S 	  Well goddamn key talk about a directorial debut
 Ashley C 	  Without having read the synopsis beforehand, I could tell something was up right away. And boy, oh boy was something up! I thought it was a great twist. Definitely worth the watch.
 Janice L 	  More Suspense than gore & guts horror. Perfect for fans for Black Mirror or Twilight Zone. You will be talking about the symbolism and layers upon layers of hidden meaning in this movie for days!
 Deepa J 	  This movie was deeply creepy, scary, and funny. It was neat that even if you are white, you can feel the isolation of the main character and feel his unease. It was interesting in many ways. It examines liberal notions like that you must not be racist if you voted for Obama...like Tiger Woods...admire black people because you think they are athletically superior...It was just very interesting. Go see it!
 Domenic G 	  Brilliant movie in almost every aspect. Funny yet horrifying. Unlike any horror movie I have ever seen (coming from a horror fan)
 Kirk D 	  Enjoyed this movie - some spoiler - reminded me of the film 'Society'. The story arc has a done and seen and felt before sensation. Never seen Allison Williams in anything before - but will be looking out for her future films - her transformation from amazing girlfriend to cold physco - is central to the film. Big mentions to to Cathrine Keener, Daniel Kaluuya and Lil Rel Howery. Go see.
 Allyson B 	  Sheds a super layered yet entertaining light on the cringey, less-acknowledged "liberal racism." ??
 Michelle D 	  Average movie....not sure what all the hype is about....
 Justin S 	  This country needs to talk about Nice Racesism.
 Private U 	  Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 99%. This is a must see.
 Tonia B 	  All I can say is wow, best movie in the longest time.
 Ryan M 	  Nothing original in this film. Basically the Skeleton Key with a bunch of racial tension. This 99% has me thinking politics play a role in a critics voice.......
 Yang L 	  skip the trailer and go watch the movie
 Jon L 	  In short, this movie is an experience. You will be saying "wtf" and "holy shit" more times than you can count. Marketing this as a horror movie was an ingenious move, drawing in unsuspecting viewers and blowing them away with a brilliantly directed psychological thriller. Jordan Peele uses this film to make a number of ambitious statements about race in our society, leaving the audience shaken to the core.
 Rym M 	  I curse the person who made this amazing movie lose its 100 % rating. Best horror movie I've seen in a while.Bravo  Jordan Peele, il a russi  se rapproprier le genre et  offrir  ce film une porte sociale.
 Sarah K 	  Perfect except for unnecessary jump scares (including some that didn't make sense). Must see.
 Malory G 	  I give this five stars it was absolutely great I strongly recommend if you are bringing kids the only inappropriate parts are swearing there is nothing else inappropriate it is a funny and scary movie and it is my favorite movie I've seen all year.
 Ieesha C 	  Insanely good! Also, it was insane.
 Ariely G 	  It's entertaining and it's full of metaphors!
 Ethan p 	  wonderful. must see movie for 2017
 Simon G 	  Tonight's Scream Unseen was Get Out and I couldn't be happier as it was one of my must see's! A beautifully shot, extremely creepy and a very unique film. My only criticism is that the were far too many funny moments for me that drew me out of the scare factor abit but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.
 Lhylia T 	  Brilliant movie had me on the edge of my seat
 Damion G 	  Movie of the Month "Get Out" by Jordan Peele
 Kathy B 	  I liked it but a little spooky
 Bryan L 	  Just awful! The acting was much much better than the script. A seemingly 70s throwback horror film. But I seen it all before. Eerily similar to one of my all time fanorites, The Skeleton Key, just not as believable.
 Brandon E 	  A brilliant horror movie. It's definitely one of its kind, due to the subject nature. As we all know from the previews, it's about an interracial couple who visits the girlfriends parents and a whole lot of awkward stuff happens. I would say this movie is a blend of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and Stepford Wives.The genre of this film would be a comedy horror. I applaud the filmmakers for not making this a film that relies heavily on jump scares. Originally that was one the elements I thought was going to deter me from seeing this. However there are really no jump scares in the movie. Which is great because what I love about this film is that it understands that atmosphere is the key element in horror. Not cheap scares to make you twitch in your seat. The director did a great job at conjuring the atmosphere, you feel as if the characters are in a quiet, secluded area. Even the cliche "loss of phone coverage" is in the movie, however it works in the movie. We as the audience get a sense that we are removed from the normal world. That's due to the atmosphere and the characters obviously. Now to the characters. Jordan Peele is a genius for these characters. For generations blacks know of these type of people. And Peele did a great job in portraying them in this film. As a black man, I don't know how many times people told me they voted for Obama. Or how many times people have made allusions to stereotypes that are linked to my race. There's a term called positive stereotypes. These are perceptions that society grants over certain groups under the "notion" that it benefits said group. Examples would be Blacks are great athletes or Asians are great at math. While upfront it may seem like a compliment but when you look deeper a stereotype will always a stereotype. Therefore those who hold strong beliefs in that stereotype, only socially accepts those who uphold the stereotype. It also makes it hard for others within the group. Not all blacks are athletes and not all asians are good at math. Those individuals are likely to be shunned from society for not upholding the stereotypes. When you look at it negative or positive, all stereotypes are bad because you've relegated a race to a few traits. The characters in the dinner party scene have a creepy admiration for the main character Chris. They admire his physical attributes and try to segue each conversation into their admiration for his race. Even though I got a Rosemary's Baby vibe from how awkward the characters were portrayed, what's creepier is that these people exist. I love the fact that Peele did not display the characters as prejudice, Deep South whites. However they were displayed as upwardly mobile, liberal whites. Who support equality and the liberal agenda however they are so far removed from outside their peer group. Due to their position in society they don't really socialize with black people within their circle. However that doesn't make them racist, sure they admire African Americans but they took the time to actually get to know and understand. Growing up black, I was always told to be weary of those types who will smile at the front and stab in the back.The comedy is funny, Chris's freind the TSA is hilarious. He portrays his character in a way that doesn't come off as annoying. The best scene with his character is at the precinct. There are also some funny scenes involving the family. When I mean funny, the humor is done in a satirical fashion.There is a reason this film has such a high rotten tomato score. I know it sounds hacky but the film has never been told before in this style and released from a major studio. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, even if you're not a horror fan you will appreciate this movie. It's very reminiscent of a segment of the Twilight Zone. Congrats for Jordan Peele for putting together a brilliant movie that needs to be told. So for those who see this can stop telling me that they voted for Obama twice and would voted for him again if possible.
 James C 	  This was a good weird movie. A lil slow in the beginning but ohhhhh what an ending.
 Kathy L 	  Brilliant social commentary! And such scary fun!
 Jake R 	  Despite devolving into mindless violence in its third act, Get Out still manages to use its fresh premise to entertain with comedy, horror, and a remarkable amount of creativity, all presented with a powerful score and heavy racial metaphors.
 Nick R 	  Bunch of liberal BS. Shouldn't have even watched this garbage. We know why critics gave it a good score
 Silvana P 	  Absolutely incredible. Everyone in the audience, including myself, would applaud throught the movie due to how intelligent and crafty the main protagonist was. Comedic, suspensful, frightening, and undoubtley well written, this movie is definitely worth your time.
 Jennifer G 	  Best horror movie I've seen in a long time and gave me an unexpected respect for the TSA
 Bryan S 	  Is great in every way
 Greg S 	  This may be the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen Spice World. It wasn't anything anyone is saying about it. I feel like this is a big trick by everyone who saw this movie already and is saying it is good. It's like they wasted their money and time and wanted the rest of us to waste the same. This movie is just plain awful on every level. Where can I get my money back?
 Corey G 	  Nothing is perfect....but this movie comes damn close to perfection. As a horror film, its a breath of fresh air in a stale genre. As a conversation piece, it contains social commentary that needs to be discussed. Well worth the price of admission.
 Ray M 	  Most cleverly done racist propaganda ever!
 Chad V 	  Sorry this movie is ok and really overrated
 Elizabeth H 	  V b B.B. R. T dc t ttt. Box h. B BBC bzzs bbggg vvvvvvv. Vvvv vvsv v. Vvv v r t Trc T tyrtty. CBC c c
 Yvonne M 	  Best horror/thriller I've seen in years!
 Jeffrey H 	  good show, kept me on the edge of my seat, well done Mr. Peele!
 Walead W 	  Fun movie-going experience, especially in a packed house.
 Richard K 	  Amazing. There are jump scares, but they aren't the focus. This is a chilling slow burn based on real race relations most could relate to.
 Cindy K 	  This movie had comedy, suspense and good writing. A must see for. Anyone over age of R rating. Many laughs and many moments where you're sitting at the edge of your seat! However I think that social values have evolved and mixed rave couples are generally accepted. IMO.
 Hina A 	  thoughtful and haunting, this is a movie that may not surprise you, but will leave you mindful of your own prejudice
 Tyler P 	  no thrill at all but does have some humor but left dissatisfied. don't build up a movie as thriller and leave out the thrill. very disappointed
 Erik R 	  Excellent movie! Thoughtful, exciting and creative. I see lots of angry white men spouting off their racist drivel in some of these comments, but they obviously haven't seen the movie. It liberally bashes liberals too.
 Shaun H 	  Phenomenal movie. Very surreal yet authentic at the same time. Must see!
 John H 	  Wow this movie was interesting! In a good way.
 John S 	  Fans of Jordan Peele and most folks should love this---very well done horror story with a lot of racial commentary in between---but never preachy. Good flick-- well worth a look!
 Gayle P 	  Did not enjoy this movie at all. Was long, boring, and acting seemed very blah. Movie was also easy to predict what was going to happen. Peele's character was my favorite part.
 Irma P 	  Brilliant movie that brings to light the fact that we don't live in a post racial society. Though slavery has ended and we had a black president, even liberal white America is complicit in finding innovative ways to profit off of black bodies. If you like Black Mirror, you'll definitely love this movie.
 John M 	  really gud movie had me deep in thought!
 A%20 U 	  The Stepford Whiteys. Is that concise enough? It's boring, predictable and for all this talk about it 'addressing' racism - sorry. It just car-jacks it and drives it over to a friend's house. You know that friend, the one that tells you exactly what you want to hear and you already agree on it so there's really nothing being addressed. Not scary, not insightful, and worst of all, NOT FUN. Junk.
 Kayleb D 	  Such a unique move, that is so with the time!
 Michelle N 	  Great acting! I tried really hard to like the film, but simply, not scary at all. I typically love horror and thrillers. Could not wait to see it and left the theater feeling disappointed and wishing we had chosen to see Cure for Wellness instead. Save your money and rent it when it comes out on Redbox.
 Kaygee A 	  Absolutely incredible movie! Well put together. Great story. Great acting. Subtle twists. Just the right amount of humor. A little real life thrown in. Well timed gotcha moments...just to make sure you're paying attention. No, that wasn't a trick, you really just saw that... It leaves you impatiently asking what's next, but not wanting to know the details in expectation of the surprise. I don't want to give ANYTHING away...excellent movie. Instant classic.
 Lee G 	  99% rotten tomatoes? I figured it out--that lame psychiatrist in the movie hypnotized the critics with that same tea cup! STAY AWAY from psychiatrists with tea cups or you too will be duped into believing this lame plot is actually good.
 Jeffrey P 	  I rarely leave a movie really satisfied, but this was a GREAT film!
 Saddam H 	  4 in the pink and one in the gas chamber
 Jerry S 	  Great movie must see. Like the little twist
 Jeremy I 	  If you are a hive minded Hollywood liberal moron (like 100% of the critics who reviewed this film), you will applaud this for absolutely trashing white people. That or you will be afraid to give it a bad rating because you'd be a racist not to support blanket antagonization of whites. This film had some interesting and funny moments, I won't deny that. But to give it a 99% rating is beyond ridiculous. It is obviously politically motivated/slanted of a grade, thanks to idiotic progressive shut ins in charge of critiquing. These people live in an alternate reality where all minorities are victims and whitey is the devil. So a movie like this feeds their deluded ideoligical fantasies to euphoric levels. The film overall was predictable, not scary, and used every stereotype in the book to hammer one message into your skull ... white people cannot be trusted or allied with ... ever!! This is what so-called progressivism gets you, folks.
 James S 	  This was scary good with a social message attached to it also. Loved it!!
 Latessa H 	  Best movie I have seen in a long time!!!!
 Grant H 	  Brilliant movie! It's a must see
 Brittany R 	  this movie was amazing
 Jon F 	  unique, creepy, effective!
 Jamel R 	  From the first trailer, I thought I'd like this movie. But this really exceeded all of my expectations. Jordan Peele really did a great job in his directorial debut. Get Out is tense, thoughtful and hilarious. Definitely one I'll be adding to my Blu-ray collection.
 Kevin A 	  What a great movie I really enjoyed it.
 Robert M 	  A fine B movie. Catherine Keener frightened us, but not too badly because the man behind me fell asleep, twice, and snored.
 Esteban F 	  An excellent piece of paranoia horror.
 Charlie S 	  So much more than just a horror movie. The script is tight as a drum, the pacing flawless, the slowly ratcheting tension is absolutely heart stopping, the comic relief is side splitting, the acting is excellent, and the whole thing is wrapped in an incisive metaphor for institutionalized racism. This may be the best horror movie ever made. An absolute triumph for Jordan Peele.
 John D 	  A lot of ratings it does not deserve for typical reasons. It is a decent movie. It is worth seeing. It certainly and intentionally promotes racial tension that wasn't called for and does very little for the plot! B- Movie!
 Mayra H 	  The story line is absolutely ridiculous and stupid. I wish I could get my $15 back. Save your money and time!
 Eric L 	  Amazing movie. Go see it. To the critics writing paragraphs and paragraphs, get a life.
 Marcus W 	  Awesome movie might go see it again!! ????
 CC B 	  Such a great movie!!! Cant wait to see what Peele does next.
 Dewayne S 	  Not a bad movie, not as good as some are making it out to be either. Different kind of movie and worth seeing.
 Maria S 	  Nope. Too silly and too ineptly shoving political ideas on the viewer. I didn't laugh, and didn't get scared.
 Jacob S 	  One day, we'll be telling our cinephile grandkids about when we saw Jordan Peele's first movie in theaters, and that he was a master director even then.
 Karissa T 	  Crazy movie! Keeps you entertained the whole movie!!
 Una O 	  There's a reason you'll here folks talking about going to see this movie twice. It doesn't make sense the first time around nor should you waste your money seeing it again. This movie is the equivalent of someone giving a budget to that guy who got dumped by a white chick so he decided to write a Revenge film. Plain and simple. Anyone who has been in a interracial relationship , particularly black people who are middle-class or higher, will see this for what it is. Does racism exist? Absolutely. But this kind of foolishness is something on a whole different level of nonsense. This is one of the most racially offensive movies I have ever seen. It is the equivalent of Birth of a Nation made from the opposite perspective. Anyone who considers this a film about being intellectually woke as black people are a bit sad. I went to see this film expecting to see smart satire. Instead all I saw was a bunch of tired and trite stereotypes that will marched out pretty early on in the film. Think of every possible mundane stereotype of interracial relationships that you've ever heard of if you're an adult. He left no stone unturned. Absolutely no originality. Every single frame was highly predictable for me. Now maybe that's because I am a film buff and highly evolved. But for me, this flick was very insulting. In contrast, while people did not like Django Unchained because of the language, the satire and the use of metaphors was brilliant. I expected that in this film. Absolutely no such thing. This person wrote the script like a high schooler. The ending itself was so nonsensical that I seriously considered asking for a refund.
 Michael F 	  Scary, funny, and smart. three qualities that are hard to find in horror movies, and this one pulls it off very well.
 Slate J 	  Best movie I've seen in year's..
 Ronnie W 	  Absolutely loved this movie.
 Joy H 	  Whether you're a horror fan or not, this is an expertly crafted film.
 Brian C 	  OH MAN. This is such a good movie. It's incredibly smart and tense and disturbing. And there's just A LOT to unpack from it. I saw it this morning and have been thinking about it all day. I can't wait to see what movie Jordan Peele does next.
 B-rian N 	  Amazing movie. I would recommend it!!
 Andrew D 	  I loved everything about Get Out. It's well acted, written, and directed. While it has this amazingly detailed and bubbling racial tension under its skin its also the perfect horror/genre movie that will please horror fans. I couldn't be more delighted by Get Out.
 Jessie Z 	  A very overrated overly hyped film! I was very excited to watch the film but was very disappointed by it!
 Winston M 	  Very well played...Scariest movie since One Hour Photo for me. The actor plying Chris was genius in his performance. I could see other actors over reacting at every moment but slowly built up the tension. The ending was a bit far fetch but I like it.
 Dawn T 	  Terrible movie and just another opportunity to bash white people. This is what happens when white Hollywood gives black people the opportunity to create...destroy us and our institutions.
 Nicolette M 	  Blown way. Such a great movie.
 Gerard L 	  enjoyed a great movie..
 Seymour M 	  Get Out is a thoroughly entertaining movie. Peele puts together a story that could easily have been overly campy and cheesy into artistic film. The acting throughout is spectacular. While I think the trailer could have been less revealing, the movie is definitely worth seeing.
 Melissa C 	  WOW! That was the best thriller I've ever seen. Great story. Nice twists. Great acting.
 I M 	  Great movie to see! Definitely one of a kind!
 Rick O 	  Twists and turns will make you squirm. We liked it, but wasn't as good as the ratings.
 Joe B 	  Jordon Peele's Get Out give us an enjoyable horror flick and a good conversation piece for your next dinner party or mix-and-mingle event. Though, I'm not a horror film kinda dude, I was thoroughly entertained!
 Tyler B 	  Walked out feeling like this was a 4/5, but the movie really works on several levels. After talking incessantly about it all night, this is definitely a masterpiece. I still can't stop thinking about all the ways this movie works.
 Prince G 	  I loved it! felt like I was watching a movie from the 90's. It was original! nothing like a fresh idea and not a remake. Jordan Peele needs to do more movies
 Lindsey G 	  Modern day Stepford Wives scenario. Awkwardly psychological. Loved it!
 Sue S 	  Loved everything about this movie.
 Reenie L 	  I'm generally not into horror flicks but I gave this one a try and really enjoyed it!
 Andrew E 	  A movie about a black guy
 Mark J 	  I had no clue what was going to happen in this movie. That part I liked. It was slow paced and was boring at times. Original but I left feeling like I hadn't watched anything substantial. Overrated!
 Ariana L 	  Absolutely loved this movie. Made valid points toward racism and was also witty. Will definitely be going to see this again before it leaves theaters as well as buying it.
 Terrence B 	  Great movie! Definitely a must see. Any negative ratings are just trying to be difficult
 Courtney B 	  Wow what a movie, great concept. Loved it from the beginning to the end.
 Vince R 	  A very unexpectedly excellent experience that drives home the intended point (white supremacy) that is a VERY tense and well acted film! Lots of subtext so definietly worth seeing multiple times. Excellence in film writing and directing! If you can, see this with a full theatre...it'll add to the experience???!
 Jim S 	  A super fun thrill ride from beginning to end. Great performances back up this well written thriller that will keep you enthralled, if not guessing what the hell is going on, right to the end. No surprise that Peel was able to throw in some perfectly timed comic relief in one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while.
 Daniel M 	  Had to see it after hearing all the great things about it. Really unique movie!
 Jeff L 	  very good movie. definitely a psychological thriller.. the actors did an excellent job in it... all I know is, Jordan Peele had to be on something when he wrote this... kind of trippy.
 Michael N 	  This was surprisingly very entertaining!
 Carlos M 	  te mantiene en suspenso toda la pelcula, creyendo que sabes lo que pasa y..... sorpresa!
 JOYCE B 	  Very surprised that it was a good funny movie!!
 Michael R 	  While Get Out is more tense and off-putting than it is scary, it's also more thought provoking and unsettling than most current horror has to offer. A seemingly straight forward plot that keeps a brisk pace, the movie is extremely entertaining social satire that works on multiple levels.
 Graham B 	  Up there with the classics. Builds suspense then lets you have it! A horror film Alfred Hitchcock would appreciate. It seems to almost hypnotize you like it does to the main character then turns very creepy and throws in some gore at the end. Very well made movie, reminds me of other great films such as Hostel with a new age feel like Cabin in the Woods.
 Jeannie S 	  excellent movie! A nice surprise
 Alex D 	  The fact that this is Jordan Peele's first film that he wrote and directed is astounding. Peele makes a film that manages to be both highly entertaining as well as injecting extremely smart social commentary about race. All the performances are fantastic, especially Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford who are just creepy as hell in this. There are so many cool and disturbing twists and turns that really got under my skin in the best way possible. A film by Jordan Peele (from Key & Peele fame), you'd obviously expect some comedy in this. While there is not a lot of it in this movie, but when it is it hits HARD. The character of Rod played by Lil Rel Howry is so funny. Hadn't laughed that hard at a character in a while. Peele is also obviously influenced by many classic horror films like Rosemary's Baby, and does some cool visual tributes to other films that horror fans will spot and like. Overall, this is a fantastic horror film that is extremely smart and layered and will definitely raise discussion after the credits roll.
 Cat V 	  Hopefully this trend will stop, but for now trash like this will still scare people into saying "it's a rellay good commentary on society"
 John E 	  I might take a vow of celibacy.
 Sharon R 	  Knocked my effing sox off!
 J RICH ON THE B 	  This movie is a must see for all. It's funny, thrilling, disturbing, scary, then funny again then scary again. You take a ride on a thought provoking journey with this film. Great job Jordan Peele and all the actors involved. Bravo.
 Damonique W 	  Legendary movie..love it so much
 Andrea M 	  Nice -- very well-played social commentary and thrill ride. Gets a little harsh in regards to where it leads, but it really is one of the best horror films I've seen in a while.
 Paul W 	  Slightly above average. The story has been done before. The plot was mostly predictable. The social overtones were very heavy handed and gratuitous. What keep the movie from being bad was the performance of the lead actor and some very good directing.
 Eric P 	  Despite the super strong smell of weed in the theatre this was an awesome flick!
 Matt H 	  Don't Get Out, stay in! Not really sure why all the critical acclaim. This was a completely different movie than I was expecting. TSA sidekick (Lil Rel Howery) was the standout in an otherwise lackluster experience.
 Michael W 	  This was the Best movie I have seen all year. You look at Race differently once you see this...
 Maciek S 	  The worst movie ive ever had the misfortune of seeing. Made me feel very much like the dead horse being beaten repeatedly. Not a satire, not a horror, mildly suspensful, garbagee i would not feed to pigs.
 Jaime S 	  suprising great film. Tense yet comical at times.
 Gustavo P 	  Excellent, they have put together a little bit of action, love, horror and comedy in the perfect balance.
 Justin C 	  This movie was and crazy good at the same time
 Liam C 	  Brilliant, Unnerving, and so very important. Jordan Peele makes a horror film that doubles as a brutal social commentary that will be dissected for years to come.
 Medi S 	  As a minority, I'm tired of this race-bait race-skewed trash. Why do liberals make everything about race? It's 2017, and we still play these stupid games that make White person the bad guy. Give me a break, liberalism is a mental disorder. Just ask what happens to a minority when they step off the plantation, they get called the most disgusting racist names. Save your money, shit is garbage. White privilege my ass, my dark skin gives me more privilege than any White person could even imagine.
 Cara L 	  It was great! Had every genre included in the movie. O waa freaked out, scared, and laughing hard throughout the movie. Loved it!!
 Gabe M 	  A Hitchcock-esq thriller keeping me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.
 Gabriel G 	  Really good movie!!!
 Collin R 	  while incredibly overrated it was alot better then I expected just from the trailer. The things I expected to be bad were, such as the attempts at making it creepy by playing music over a lingered shot of certain characters or the whole hypnotizing scene. I think alot of the praise of this movie may come just cause the focal point of the movie is race where as if this was just if it was a normal horror movie with racism removed it wouldnt have been so highly rated. Yet with that said pretty much everything expect the attempts at horror I liked about the movie
 Brandi L 	  I was VERY excited to see this, but was disappointed. Acting wasn't awesome. Main character Chris was the best actor in my opinion. Great parts scattered throughout a mediocre movie.
 Nabhan K 	  Great Movie! Too much symbolism! Very entertaining! Def will watch it again
 Keith s 	  Good movie but overhyped. Not scary at all.
 Connor L 	  Most overhyped movie I've ever seen. Lacked so much to make it 100% or even 90% score. Yes it was creative, yes it had humor. Overall, it was nothing we haven't seen before in other horror movies and does not deserve the score received. I enjoyed it to an extent, but just felt as though I couldn't enjoy it enough because of the underserved attention. I went in with extremely high hopes and wanting to love it, as a fan of horror and psychological mystery, but came out extremely disappointed.
 Laurence D 	  Haven't seen it yet but judging by nearly every review & comment it looks like another race baiting movie making white people look bad. I think that's why this movie is currently at 99%, because racism is ok once the target of the racism is white people. Maybe I'm wrong about the movie, but with nearly every comment referencing racism & "white privilege" (a nonsense phrase) then it must go pretty deep into the movie. With so many moronic comments about "White Privilege" & racism, racism, racism. How anyone can even be around people who talk like that, you have to be a seriously sick person to spew nonsense like micro aggressions & the rest of the SJW crap. I'm sick to death listening to delusional people. I do have to laugh though, in two newspaper reviews they used the same phrase "seemingly liberal parents", as if liberals can't be bad people, it's laughable, all the bad people I've met in life were liberals.
 Diane C 	  Best movie I've seen in awhile. It was funny, witty, scary with a very curious plot. I want to see it again!
 Hardeep M 	  the movie was near perfect besides the part where he sees all the "proof" in a box
 Brandon P 	  Such a great film! A perfect mix of comedy, horror, suspense, and even social commentary!
 Andrew H 	  first 5-star rating i've given in a while. a lot had to do with the experience, most fun i've had at the movies in a long time, this reminded me of why i love going. went by myself on a saturday night, the theater was full and the audience was totally into it. this was a very clever thriller with the perfect balance of scary, funny, and social commentary. had a fun time
 Lincoln P 	  Wow! I don't like scary movies, but this is one of the best I've seen. Must see!
 Justin K 	  Just saw this movie, story that keeps you on your heels and everything fits together, really recommend this movie
 Jo F 	  I expected to "Get Out" to be a horror comedy since it's written and directed by Jordan Peele of "Key & Peele." But, it's a legit horror movie that--to me--owes a lot to "Rosemary's Baby" in the way it builds tension through one unsettling incident after another. At just the right moments, the tension is broken by the movie's one super-funny character. I won't say more at the risk of ruining it for anyone. It's so good. I really recommend it with the warning that it does earn its R rating (mostly with language). To me, this is the best horror movie since 2016's "Don't Breathe" (though it's completely different). Go see it before you hear too much about it. 9/10.
 Jordin T 	  Singlehandedly the best movie of the past decade. Equal parts funny, witty, well-thought out, scary, and REAL. The whole hypnosis/body snatching thing is obviously fictional, but any African-American has experienced these subtle racist situations with white people before.
 Alonzo R 	  After all the buzz I had to see this movie, and the positive vibe was well deserved. It's not really a horror movie, though. It's more of a suspense thriller with some humor sprinkled in. I can't say that I've seen anything quite like it, and to say anything could spoil it. Suffice to say that it was a really good thriller.
 Cooper M 	  different from expected
 Kara S 	  This movie was in a word, amazing. Peeled did an amazing job of hiding symbolism and secrets well enough that the audience could decipher them but not reveal too much. The movie is secret political statement and done extremely well. A new horror classic
 Shamika M 	  different type of movie that makes u wonder is this happening for real!!!
 Dan D 	  Genius. See it in a theatre for full experience.
 Damian R 	  Fantastic movie. The devil is in the details. Anyone with racial consciousness would enjoy this movie.
 Lincoln P 	  The thing about it is, now that they've put it in a movie, you won't think it's real
 Michelle P 	  Interesting & different but not 5 star worthy in my opinion. Great actors, plot reminded me a little of "the stepford wives" due to the deceptiveness of an innocent looking community/family yet underneath their true intentions revealed.
 Nya S 	  Great Satire on the Black ExperienceYou have to see this movie more than once. Peele delivers here and there is a chance you'll pick up on something you missed the first time.
 Laura G 	  Amazing movie, unpredictable ending. Enjoyed this movie, very well done
 Jarrett M 	  Why I'm never dating a white girl.
 Jimmy B 	  It was okJust not a fan of introducing comedy into what I had hoped would be an intense nail bite and kind of a silly ending
 Rosa C 	  This movie was mind-blowing! The closest comparison I can come up with is perhaps "Apocalypse Now". The acting was superb and the writing was excellent.
 Finn S 	  Omfg that was amazing
 John R 	  This movie is about a black family kidnapping white people and transplanting there brain into the white body because they believe the white race were physically genetically superior to the black race. Oh wait, that would be racist, its they other way around; they transplanted the white brain into the black body. The movie is really quite offensive to the white race, how this received a 99% from critics is mind blowing. If they did reverse the races on this, I assure you it would not be rated this high.
 Heather E 	  Brilliant! One of the best films I have seen in a VERY long time! A movie has never made me want to laugh and cry at the exact same time. I was on the edge of my seat every second of it!
 Rog G 	  An outstanding movie!!! Well written story, that has many fresh ideas, that keeps you interested, with lots of suspense, and some humor..Keeps you interested and left me hoping that the movie would never end. This is a must see, that is fresh, and void of repeated thing,s that has been the case, in other horror movies.
 Marshall P 	  This movie was too good. I liked the ending a lot.
 Fred R 	  The movie was okay. Not bad but not great. I don't understand the fabulous reviews. Not scary and has some humorous moments but not a comedy.
 Colby S 	  Amazing. Constantly keeps you at the edge of your seat.
 Jacques P 	  I walked into this movie with great expectations because of the reviews and Jordan Peele's direction, but was sadly dissatisfied by a very confused movie. There was too much comedic relief which offset the horror. Sadly, much of the horror in the movie is reduced to jump scares. The hyposis sequences are fantastically well made. The movie was very well shot and acted for the most part. The "race elements" were well handled and thought-provoking, even if I may not agree completely with it. The climax and the ending of Get Out had me saying to myself, "That's it," that's all you can muster up with your innumerable usages of horror cliches. There was social commentary, but horror or suspense?
 Arlene W 	  I saw this last night and wow is all I can say without spoiling it. This is a must see.
 Adam S 	  Y'all white folks is crazy
 Mark C 	  Meh. Really not scary at all. Best scenes are in the previews. Worth seeing but 99%? C'mon. Not even remotely close. I certainly doesn't live up to the hype.
 rakesh k 	  Fearless and cuthroat!
 Christopher H 	  An impressive directorial debut from Jordan Peele that manages to be a successful horror-comedy and a super sharp satire on racism although not the type you may immediately think of.Who knew a comedian can make one of the best horror films I've seen in quite a while?
 Frdric H 	  Get out is a fresh horror movie with sometimes intense psychological horror. The story is good but some of the acting seemed a little bit cheesy which lowered my rating. Do not watch the trailer since it contains so many spoilers.
 Jhonatan M 	  Funny and scary in perfect quantities.
 Conscious Q 	  Awesome movie! Kept me guessing.
 Chris C 	  An interesting, twisted yet hilarious social commentary about race and abstract liberalism. Get Out's a film you need to closely pay attention to for all the little details & subtle allusions, especially with its use of sight; it's certainly a head scratcher that'll leave you thinking, and a very well made directorial debut for Jordan Peele, at that.
 Ben O 	  Let's be honest... as far as horror goes, this movie sucked. The storyline was highly predictable with several holes. Two for instance, 1) how did he get the cotton in his ears if restrained; 2) where did the TSA agent get a cop car. There was social commentary, but horror or suspense? NO! Most people with a negative review are probably too scared to post due to fear of being called racist. I ask this, if the victim was white, would it still be a "great" film? Again, NO!
 Jeff S 	  A mediocre, lightly suspenseful movie with a side of tacky humor added. Nothing special. Had a B rated horror feel.
 Gary G 	  Best movie I have seen since 2008 (Iron man 1).Its so good and the trailer makes the movie even better by not spoiling a thing.
 Tiffancy N 	  This was the best movie I've seen in a while... Not only did itf have me on the edge of my seat... I understood the strong message the movie was sending about African American issues... Loved it. Would see it again.... Can't wait to buy it...
 nisa t 	  Excellent movie... not a dull or awkward moment! One of the most entertaining movies that I have seen in a while. Its different from the norm. I loved it. Excellent acting. The girl reminds me of Jennifer Connellly.
 Margaret B 	  Saw this tonight and thought it was great. Scary, definitely, but also funny and truthful, with a spot-on script and pitch perfect performances.
 Darvelle F 	  Great movie from beginning to end.
 Luis R 	  I want to see this movie is a good movie a lot of people have told me to watch it
 Mike G 	  original. suspenseful. good.
 Robert G 	  At the sight of the trailers, I didn't think much of "Get Out." That is, until, I caught wind of the immense critical acclaim surrounding it. I saw it and immediately fell in love with the great cinematography and visuals along with a surprising story filled with Hitchcockian suspense.
 Rosemarie B 	  One of the most suspenseful horror films I've ever seen.
 Chris A 	  Excellent film. Blends clever humour with a very unique plot that sent shivers up my spine. What a start for Peele in the directing world and a great step forward for Daniel Kaluuya.
 Resli B 	  Recommend. Good mix of jump scares and comedy. Favorite horrorcom since Tucker and Dale vs Evil
 Donnell A 	  I was really amazed at how great this movie was. The direction and the humor in a creepy movie really stood out.
 Bryan A 	  One of the best movies I've seen this year! It has everything you want in a horror movie! Very original and well directed!
 Lama O 	  Absolutely mind-blowing movie! Never seen anything like it! By far my best movie experience.
 Yousif V 	  Good but forgettable. The TSA agent steals the show.
 Tina V 	  Get Out kept me on my toes the entire film. Every scene was intriguing, well thought out and perfectly acted. Such a fresh detour and eye opening film!
 Jack K 	  Hollywood can't help themselves. SAD!
 Demetre R 	  8.5. I originally did not want to watch this movie but since I did watch it I am very glad that I did because it was well done for this type of a movie. Nothing was overdone and it played out really well.
 Ray C 	  Really don't know how this is getting such praise and rocking a 99% on RT. Went in knowing nothing about this film but then after the first 20 minutes I could see where we were going. In the end and the reason I'm so disappointed was because with it being rated 99% you'd expect a clever new idea/twist but it wasn't until I was riding home I knew I had seen something like this and then it hit me, *SPOILERS* The Skeleton Key. This movie takes that idea basically but chose to go about telling it and doing it in a slightly different, dare I say racial way. And I guess the jokes on us/them because we (white people) now want to habitat and live in black peoples bodies which is utterly racist. All because granddad lost a track race he wants his family Ken to find good working and gifted black people to help overcome their previous shortcomings in life (looking hard at you too Self/less) this movie was fun no doubt but the idea/twist was just dumb cause we've seen it in other places before, just in a slightly different way.
 ally d 	  Mixed feelings about this one...I am really tired of the if you're white you're a racist and if you don't think you are, you are the problem mantra. This movie reeks of that. There is not one white person in the film who is appalled by what is going on...That aside- and that's a stretch... the horror story side of it is entertaining, and his friend is very funny.
 Mallory A 	  The pacing works for and against the film, but there's no denying that the conclusion makes the journey worth it.
 Andrew M 	  The absolute best Movie Theater experience of my life, Jordan Peele is a genius.
 Jill K 	  Horrible horror movie. Completely lost me at the end when the crazy story comes out. So fake. I was laughing. Do not waste your money on this movie!!
 danny m 	  not really a comedy not really a horror movie.
 Tee B 	  Great movie! Jordan Peele is a genius.
 Tashima S 	  Go See! It is a great thriller & horror film. It was well written & thought out. The friend in the movie was Hilarious! This movie did not sugarcoated some of the problems black men face i.e. Police, stereotypes BUT was not racist or racial insensitive. The ending will leave you speechless
 Liesl E 	  Clever, unsettling, intense, funny and thought-provoking. I usually prefer to watch horror movies at home with a pillow at the ready to hide behind, but am glad that I wasn't too much of a chicken to see this at the theater. Highly recommended.
 Marion S 	  Suspenseful and intriguing. Nice twist.
 Dezmon R 	  Powerful movie 20 out of 10Yes 20 out of 10!!!!
 Tim W 	  You have got to be kidding. The critics give this movie a 99% rating, really??? They gave Hacksaw Ridge an 86% and Hidden Figures a 92%. Both of those are nominated for awards, whereas this movie is doomed to oblivion. The acting is mediocre at best. The only laughs come from the use of the F-word by Rod and if that had been deleted, sorry but no funny lines at all. The script is so contrived it makes you want to laugh. The story line had to be developed for nothing more than profit for the studios. Make a movie about discrimination and "they will come". The Hollywood manipulation continues and guess what, you are the one they want to manipulate.
 Don-el L 	  This movie was a breath of fresh air! Jordan Peele took care of business in the comedy/thriller. This movie is not going to make you jump out of your seat with a bunch of cheap loud sounds. This movie kept the entire audience locked in from beginning to end. It holds your attention and keeps you invested til the end. You'll be on the edge of your seat laughing your ass off! If you are sensitive to racial jokes then this movie is not for you. If you want a good laugh, a good scare and to enjoy a fantastically done film, GET OUT! is what you want to see. ???
 Ariani R 	  This movie was AMAZING.
 Marcus C 	  Uniquely delightful! Dark yet humorous, but not tacky.
 Nic O 	  Perfect suspense coupled with timely social commentary on racial tensions in America.
 Sean B 	  One of the best films I have seen this year it has one of the best endings I've seen!
 Scooter P 	  What a trip. This movie does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat the entire film, and it all doesn't make sense... until it all kinda does. The acting is great, especially with Daniel Kaluuya and his skepticism towards everything going on around him. It really takes some strange and interesting turns, and the ending is both funny and frightening... a strange and awesome combo that really delighted me. Totally enjoyable!
 David J 	  Aside from the over-the-top hype I heard from my peers. Get Out was a great movie. 9/10 for me. Just mad to find out Rose was what she was.
 Toysorama . 	  "Get Out" seamlessly blends comedy and horror that will have you laughing one minute, and on the edge of your seat the next. And most of it works like a charm.
 Frank B 	  Very good movie. I recommend.
 Dawn B 	  Perfect noir comedy!
 Jason M 	  White people be crazy
 Cccc S 	  Terrible libturd propaganda movie.
 Tim O 	  Satire at its finest! A great piece on the political climate of today and yesteryear. Jordan Peele is an intelligent comic and director that jumps on the big screen scene with this perfect satirical film.
 Isaiah F 	  My mind is completely blown! Excellent movie. Mr. Peele should take a bow.
 Rochele H 	  Jordan Peele is going to became one of my new favorite directors and writers.This movie is amazing, and worth the 99% on RT!
 Karen H 	  Just say this film and it was great. I wished I came up with it. Funny, creepy, thrilling and made you think. I also don't see how people were calling it racist.
 Mercedes-Benz M 	  Horror has a new face and it's name is racism
 John M 	  Moments of brilliance with some more underwhelming moments but overall, insanely funny and entertaining and nonetheless thought-provoking.
 Abdullah A 	  Funny, exciting, and far fetched ideas that aren't to far off. Get out is a terrific movie that scares as well as it makes you laugh..the acting doesn't disappoint and the music is perfectly timed out (A)
 John C 	  Very amusing but don't see the racial/social satire that the critics seem to think of Get Out. Usually don't do scary but this was fun especially with an interactive audience. (3-4-17)
 Valerie P 	  Awesome movie! Great from start to finish. Very mind provoking!
 Teddy F 	  Get Out is a surprisingly good blend of comedy, thrills, and clich horror tropes. Daniel Kaluuya's acting, especially during the hypnosis scenes, was extremely good; LilRel Howery's power to lighten the mood with his humor was awesome. The environment designed is eerie and isolated and you can feel the tension between Chris and Rose's family and friends throughout. Besides a slightly rushed climax, lack of a compelling antagonist, and a predictable ending Get Out is definitely worth a look.
 LaSalle T 	  I haven't seen a horror movie I've actually wanted to see in theaters in a long time. This movie delivered and was immensely relevant to current racial America as felt by people of color. Thumbs and toes up!
 Tasha K 	  Right Movie, at the right time. Nothing is heavy handed on to social commentary, but in fact its funny / cute and yes scary for the right reasons. This was not Shakespeare but you leave really thinking about what this movie had to say as well as being thoroughly entertained, The lead actors do a fantastic job. - Go see it.
 Tessa J 	  This movie was so much fun to see in theaters. The audience was so reactive, gasping, laughing and cheering. I loved every second of this movie.
 Izzie R 	  Amazing movie. Must see.
 Alex S 	  Get Out is a brave and relevant genre-bending movie that uses its topical themes as a platform to create a unique viewing experience and promise that 2017 is going to be a good year for movies.
 Kat%20 S 	  Interesting and real social commentary meets your deepest darkest worst nightmare!!! Excellent concept. The end got a little too gory...but good nonetheless.
 Christina T 	  I would rate this movie with 10 stars but they only go up to 5.
 Karen H 	  This review contains spoilers. As much as I enjoyed this movie, I think the piling-on of the (white liberal) critics is almost as entertaining as the movie itself. There's something suspicious going on when a movie gets universal rave reviews, especially with as many plot holes as this one has. The critics derisively refer to the "white liberals" lampooned in the movie, as if they themselves are not among them. They're especially fixated on the Obama line, which probably wasn't meant to have as much import as they give it. (White people are racist if they say negative things about Obama, but also if they say positive things?)People, this is a quasi-campy horror/suspense movie that's also a mash-up of recent race-related events, which lightly riffs on awkward interracial moments. That's all. It's not a deep, profound statement on race relations in America no matter how desperately the critics want it to be. And if it was intended to be, it does not successfully pull it off, imo. The main reason is that the underlying premise that's supposed to support the evildoing in the movie doesn't hold up. It never satisfactorily explains why the sinister white people are doing what they're doing only to blacks. Instead of say, any young, strong athletic person. The one attempt in the film to explain it was so lame that it made the whole racial gimmick fall apart for me. At the same time, the racial element is necessary in order to convey the paranoia felt by the main character. The film wouldn't have worked if it was a white boy meeting the white parents. (By the way, a white person would also experience not-so-subtle hostility meeting the black parents. Black people are not necessarily more open-minded about interracial dating, something that's briefly referenced in the scene with the cellphone but curiously unmentioned by any critic.)Get Out is essentially The Skeleton Key with the races reversed, using medicine instead of black magic. The premise seems to be that these racist white "liberals" believe they're intellectually superior to blacks but that blacks are physically superior, so they put white brains inside black bodies in order to create some kind of perfect human. Supposedly they covet the physical and sexual prowess of black males. But how does that explain the black housekeeper, Georgina? Are black females also physically better? The plot device would make more sense if Rose were bringing home only star athletes, but she's not. She's bringing home random black guys (and one girl). The premise would also make more sense if the evil whites were harvesting blacks to be their servants, but they're not. The two "servants" we see turn out not to be servants at all. In Stepford Wives, which Get Out borrows from, there's no question why the men did what they did. This film left me with all kinds of questions.The point is enjoy the movie as a fun horror film, but take the racial stuff with a grain of salt and don't try to over-analyze it. The film itself didn't bother me as much as how critics and some audience members reacted to it. I made the mistake of seeing this with a mixed-race audience. Some black audience members cheered a little too enthusiastically when the white family were being killed, and as much as I'd like to believe it was because the bad guys were getting what they deserved (because I was inwardly cheering too), it seemed to be because the WHITE people were getting killed. (Imagine white audiences cheering as a white character slaughtered blacks.) I felt mildly uneasy walking out of the theater, and not in the "good" way that an effective horror film should make you feel. My advice to white people is to try to see this movie with a "non-diverse" audience if possible, otherwise some of the reactions might piss you off.Finally, to address the argument that the film is ridiculing white-liberal hypocrisy and that "white liberals" are the target of its so-called social commentary. That falls flat, because the whites here are not really "liberals," they're pseudo-liberals. They're sinister cultists masquerading as liberals, just like the "servants" are masquerading as servants. (Why is their son something out of Deliverance when the rest of them are upper-middle-class intellectuals?) It would have been nice if the film had included at least one good, redeeming white character, but it didn't. There's even a stereotypical racist white cop thrown in. So the "anti-white" accusations are not entirely off-base. Hence, three stars instead of five.
 Adam K 	  I'm not sure I can call it a horror film, Get Out is more of a killer-cultural-commentary-comedy...I think...well it's ingenious whatever it is. Director Jordan Peele tells a truly terrifying tale that is thought-provoking, hilarious, and essential. I've already seen one of the best films of 2017!
 Tyler E 	  Exciting, brutally funny, and quite often just brutal.
 Josh D 	  Not what I expected at all. Race plays a factor in this movie but not in the way you think it would and not nearly strongly as I expected. Very thrilling, entertaining and thought provoking. Great movie!
 kxng b 	  after seeing "Get Out" I was speechless. i had nothing bad to say, it was AMAZING ??????????????????
 Dave M 	  Writers are told "write what you know". For Jordan Peele, that meant writing (and directing) 2017's "Get Out" (R, 1:43), but also stretching significantly as an artist. Half of the Comedy Central comic duo of Key and Peele, Peele has been a comedian since college and is a veteran of The Second City improv troupe and MADtv. The product of an interracial marriage, much of Peele's comedy springs from his observations about race and racial divisions in the U.S., while he also uses his work as a form of social commentary on those issues. His talent and insight have earned him nominations for the Emmy Award and NAACP Image Award (multiple times each - including one Emmy win, an American Comedy Award and a Peabody Award for accomplishments in public media). Peele has also appeared in films (including 2016's "Keanu", with comedy partner Keegan-Michael Peele), television shows and internet videos. All of those experiences serve him well in "Get Out", a movie which has moments of comedy and carries implications for our racially divided modern world, but is actually more horror film than anything else. Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a New York City photographer who is preparing to drive out to the country with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), in order to meet her parents for the first time. Chris is nervous about how Rose's parents will react to their daughter dating a black man and Chris' buddy, TSA agent Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), teases him over the phone about the situation. Rose reassures Chris that her parents are very liberal and open-minded. As Rose predicted, her father, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and her mother, Missy (Catherine Keener), welcome Chris with open arms.It turns out that they are not racist, but they do make a number of racially insensitive remarks without realizing it and they employ two servants, both of whom are black. Walter (Marcus Henderson), the groundskeeper, and Georgina (Betty Gabriel), the maid, both act so politely that it seems phony to Chris, not to mention that they both speak very strangely. When Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), shows up for dinner, he is even rougher around the edges than his parents. Things get even more uncomfortable for Chris when an annual gathering at the Armitage home introduces Chris to a host of rich white people much like Rose's parents (except for a blind art dealer played by Stephen Root), while one older woman is married to a young black man (LaKeith Stanfield) who looks vaguely familiar to Chris, but who doesn't act anything like the black men that Chris knows from back in his native Brooklyn.But it's not just the way everyone acts that makes Chris uncomfortable - it's also the things that are happening around him. A police officer whom they meet after hitting a deer on a country road treats Chris like he did something wrong, even though he wasn't driving at the time. Missy, who is a psychiatrist, voices her strong opposition to Chris smoking around her daughter and insists on hypnotizing Chris in order to help him break the habit, even after Chris turns down her offer. She also keeps prodding him to talk about a painful memory from his childhood. Chris talks to Rod on the phone about the strangeness of his weekend and then Chris starts finding his phone unplugged. It also turns out that Rose hasn't been entirely forthcoming about her dating history. I'd like to say more, but I won't because, as much as I've already written, there are still plenty of surprises for the audience to discover."Get Out" is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film. Although admittedly influenced by "The Stepford Wives", what happens in this movie and why it's happening is original and sheds fresh light on the subtler manifestations of racism in America, even from sympathetic and well-meaning people and groups. In fact, it's easy to see this movie as one mainly about racism, but generally, as a Movie Fan, I see it mainly as a well-crafted horror film. There's a certain creepiness about it that starts early, and then slowly, steadily ramps up throughout the film and its appropriately unexpected and shocking reveals. Some of the plot points strain scientific credulity, but that seems to matter little in what is basically a horror fantasy. The film is perfectly cast and terrifically acted. There's also some funny, effective and well-placed comic relief (from Howery's character). That's to be expected from someone like Jordan Peele, but who knew that he would be so good at horror? This movie feels like one of M. Night Shyamalan's better films, with a strong subtext of social commentary. For so effectively presenting these elements and perfectly balancing them, this film deserves the nearly perfect grade of "A".
 Joshua B 	  Jordan Peele's directorial debut comes across as witty, intelligent, biting, and extremely well developed. The plot is driven by an excellent narrative that takes liberty with a deep look into the normalization of racism and ownership. Combining a satire, not just of the horror genre, but of class-struggle and race-relations, Peele opens us up to an honest look and an honest scare on multiple levels.
 Joe K 	  Excellent movie and intense. Must see.
 Regenia A 	  Great movie. I would see it again.
 Alex T 	  Amazing movie all the way through. Funny, unique, and thrilling. Great cast as well. If you're a white person unwilling to see this movie due to delusions of racism, you're a baby. Sincerely,A white person
 Bob C 	  Did not live up to any of the reviews. Seemed too similar to "another" movie that came out years ago. Racist movie in my opinion. All these are just opinions though...........
 Daisy P 	  More of this ? When will it stop?
 Daniel P 	  Great movie, woke up still thinking about it. May see it again with my girlfriend
